128,"Original title: Mononoke Hime

The film is set in the 14th Century during Japan’s Muromachi Period.

Young Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too.

He leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power – proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one.

On his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious.

When Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (“Spirits of things”).

Ashitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest.

To add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi.

That is an abstract of the plot.

Miyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular.

I think it’s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan.

The film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn’t one of them).

Part of the reason for the film’s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled “goodies” and “baddies.” Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she’s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi’s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say “they are humans, they must be killed” – to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals – is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a “racist” attitude here – demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans’ industrialisation, not a deliberate act.

I hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It’s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that.

You’ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it’s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.

I thoroughly recommend the film.","Original title: Mononoke Hime

128,"When a village is tormented by a wild boar, it falls to the young ""Ashitaka"" to sort it out. Turns out though, that it isn't an ordinary beast - and in the fight the man is afflicted with a curse that requires his journey to the great tree god to put right. His travels lead him to the unscrupulous ""Lady Eboshi"" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.","When a village is tormented by a wild boar, it falls to the young ""Ashitaka"" to sort it out.

""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH, as well as the numerous biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. This itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.

Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to **SPOILERS**): 

The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, simpleminded child-race. His sudden change into ""maturity"" represents how humanity needs to ""grow-up."" This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange actions helped feed this negative mindset. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands? 

The judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an Asian scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn it. Although Klaatu was the primary agent, he wasn’t necessarily alone. Gort was there and he was only partially robotic, as well as Mr. Wu. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another.

The military attacks because their modus operandi is to defend the nation, which was augmented by the destructive nature of humanity in general. 

When Bate's character finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was the government’s proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own.

The biggest sphere was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.

The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the the installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.

Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and their intrinsic bent toward destruction. The way he put it was: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.

The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. They monitored the planet for centuries and their decision was carefully decided.

To write-off humanity's destructive bent as ""minor-league carelessness"" is shallow and un-enlightened, as well as wholly inaccurate.

The aliens' actions had nothing to do with ""might makes right"" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would wholly destroy it (people) if they failed to act. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.

Really, the only ""detestable characters"" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of beauty, reverence and wisdom while the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is unlikable because she represents the government and comes off as an arrogant machine-like biyatch. After she's completely humbled, however, she changes her tune. Meanwhile the kid is only 9 years old and lost both of his biological parents; cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune and Klaatu takes on the role of his spiritual father. How can you NOT feel for Jacob when he falls on his face at his dad's grave? 

So none of the common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is simply the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy. If people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.

40508,"Let's delve into the rise and fall of the three ninjas franchise. Initially, the original “3 Ninjas” stands out as a remarkable film, even though it may not have received the same critical acclaim as others. It exudes a fun 90s vibe that resonates with many viewers. The characters Rocky, Colt, and Tumtum are engaging, especially in their martial arts pursuits under the guidance of their grandfather, Tanaka. While the film lacks in-depth martial arts training, it still retains a nostalgic charm that endears it to audiences, making it a cult classic worth revisiting.

The sequel, while decent, faced challenges with the recasting of Rocky and Tumtum, disrupting the continuity of the original cast. Despite this, the replacements manage to maintain the film's fun and entertaining essence, although it falls short of its predecessor. The lack of martial arts development persists, but the presence of the grandfather adds continuity to the franchise.

The third installment attempted to reunite the original cast for a nostalgic touch, yet the decision to recast once again puzzled viewers. While incorporating Indian culture and indigenous heroes, the film comes across as cheesy and lacks re-watch value, except for the reunion of the original cast members, notably the grandfather.

The franchise's downfall came with the fourth film, a disastrous attempt featuring Hulk Hogan and a Pamela Anderson look-alike in a money-grabbing amusement park takeover plot. The casting of Tumtum was particularly egregious, leading to a lackluster performance. Rocky and Colt were relegated to side characters, detracting from the essence of the three ninjas. The film's shift towards a villain-centric narrative fighting the FBI was seen as the franchise's lowest point, contributing to its eventual demise and disappearance from the spotlight.","Let's delve into the rise and fall of the three ninjas franchise.

When I first heard about this, I thought what is this overrated actor doing here when the National Geographic decided to deliver an important message. The world would listen to the stars like Brad Pitt, Spielberg or the James Cameroon. Then I thought if he has the loudest voice in the American, then he's the right person to do the job for his nation. Because literally UN is the US.

It all began with his little speech at the 2016 Oscars. Then I did not realise, but after watching this, everything makes sense. Anyway, he was average, he just toured the world and did what asked for, the rest of the job done by the film crew, but the film and its message certainly not neglactable. So my appreciation goes to the writer, director and the production house.

Okay, let's talk about the film. It is not just an important film, but a very, very important film. So they made sure it to easily accessible by everyone around the world in different platform. Some people are encouraged when they watch films like this, but soon after they go to their regular thing. We do not need that kind of attitude here, because it is already late and we can't reverse the damages that's already been done, though it can be prevented from happening further. Like I said in my 'Racing Extiction' review, a small contribution by everyone matters a lot.

The actor who is appointed as the United Nations 'Messenger of Peace' is set to travel the world for three years to observe and collect the information about the impact of man made global warming. Actually, he never asked any genuine question to whom he's interviewing for this documentary, like they are maybe the experts, scientists or the leaders around the world. But the goal was covered, even if it was a small amount. Because the first thing you have to understand about this film is, unlike any similar climate change documentaries, this did not try hard to give a complete picture on its topic. It was just an observation and its report kind of film by an actor who was chosen by the UN.

> ""If you consider this vastness of this universe, this planet earth is just a small boat. If this boat is sinking, then I think we will have to all sink together.""

At some point, this film was beyond that. We had seen all the debates in the previous documentaries, but the perspectives were different with the same message, I mean the warning. Because it does not stop here, if we does not change and the message is going to be very louder and louder every time. What the actor saw through his own eyes on his journey were the separate incidents/disasters from different parts of the world what we had seen in a single film like '2012'. And who knows, that kind of collapse might go to happen as well in a near future if we don't act today.

The common line from all these documentaries are 'the global warming is real and it's happening right now'. But to whom it is said? For every person, the citizens of the earth, including you and me. I liked what in this film they pointed out, that the leaders listens people who voted them. Because they say only what we wanted to listen. So if we pressure them, they will fall in line. And this thing is badly needed to come to effect in the United States. If the America change their attitude, so the world would, because that's what had followed in the 21st century. But it seems they are lagging behind compared to the Baltic countries who are going fossil fuel- free nations.

This film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story. So do we need one if the polar ices completely meltdown? The answers is a big YES. Like the one that we saw in the film '2012'. Not for the whole world, but for those poor little island inhabitants. The continent's coast locals will relocate to inland. The fun part is the islanders did nothing big to suffer this, but those who did are going to be kind of safe in the mainland.

Every living organism, either in the land or in the ocean has the right to live just like us. So we must look from their perspective as well, because we're controlling the earth, not they are. We decide the earth's fate and it should be a good one, keeping in mind humanity's future as well.

This film has done its job, it's now on us to act. Don't think it is the government or the corporate's job, we all have our part to contribute and yes, it is so tiny, but the result will be enormous when we saw it together with everyone's contribution. Just watching a film like this is no use, we need to educate around us, especially for those has no opportunity to watch them or unable to understand them. This is a must see film and try to share the disc with your friends and colleagues. Because keeping it in your blu-ray/DVD case safe forever is no use. 'Before the Flood' is present, there won't be a sequel called 'After the Flood', because we might not here to make one.

This film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story. So do we need one if the polar ices completely meltdown? The answers is a big YES. Like the one that we saw in the film '2012'. Not for the whole world, but for those poor little island inhabitants. The continent's coast locals will relocate to inland. The fun part is the islanders did nothing big to suffer this, but those who did are going to be kind of safe in the mainland.

Every living organism, either in the land or in the ocean has the right to live just like us. So we must look from their perspective as well, because we're controlling the earth, not they are. We decide the earth's fate and it should be a good one, keeping in mind humanity's future as well.

This film has done its job, it's now on us to act. Don't think it is the government or the corporate's job, we all have our part to contribute and yes, it is so tiny, but the result will be enormous when we saw it together with everyone's contribution. Just watching a film like this is no use, we need to educate around us, especially for those has no opportunity to watch them or unable to understand them. This is a must see film and try to share the disc with your friends and colleagues. Because keeping it in your blu-ray/DVD case safe forever is no use. 'Before the Flood' is present, there won't be a sequel called 'After the Flood', because we might not here to make one.

- ""Paul Schrader on _First Reformed_: ""This is a troubling film about a troubled person"""" (Alissa Wilkinson); _Vox_ (June 18, 2018)

Most reviews I've seen of _First Reforme_d have praised it as Paul Schrader's best work since either _Taxi Driver_ (1976) or _Raging Bull_ (1980). And whilst I think that's an oversimplification, unjustly ignoring such strong screenplays as _The Last Temptation of Christ_ (1988) and _Bringing Out the Dead_ (1999), and very unjustly ignoring such superb directorial work as _Affliction_ (1997) and _Auto Focus_ (2002), there can be little doubt that First Reformed is easily his best film of the last fifteen years or so. Which wouldn't be hard when you consider films like _The Canyons_ (2013), _Dying of the Light_ (2014), and _Dog Eat Dog_ (2016).

The film tells a deceptively simple story - Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the parish priest of a small congregation in the Snowbridge suburb of New York. A former military chaplain, Toller is struggling with the death of his son, Joseph, who he encouraged to enlist, and who was killed several months into his first tour in Iraq. As a result, Toller's marriage fell apart, with his wife blaming him for Joseph's death. As the film begins, Toller's spiritual crisis is already well under way. He's drinking too much, doesn't show much interest in his official duties, doesn't seem bothered that his congregation has dwindled to about ten people, and has taken to recording his thoughts in a journal which he plans to keep for one year, and then destroy. After Sunday mass, Toller is approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), one of his parishioners, who is worried about her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger). A radical environmentalist who has just been released from prison in Canada, Michael has developed extreme nihilistic views, and wants Mary to abort their unborn child because he doesn't think anyone has the right to bring a child into a dying world. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Mary persuades Toller to counsel Michael. Meanwhile, the 250th anniversary of the First Reformed church from which Toller works is fast approaching, with a huge service to be attended by both the governor and mayor.

The above plot summary takes up roughly the first twenty minutes or so of the film, almost up to the end of the first act. At that point, it looks as if the narrative is heading in the direction of following Toller as he sets about changing Michael's extreme worldview. But that's not where it goes at all, instead focusing almost exclusively on the disintegration of Toller's faith, and the development of his own nihilistic outlook. Along the way, it introduces us to three main supporting characters – Reverend Joel Jeffers (Cedric Antonio Kyles) of Abundant Life, the megachurch that owns First Reformed, and who gave Toller his job; Esther (Victoria Hill), choirmaster at First Reformed, who had a brief sexual relationship with Toller after his marriage ended; and Edward Balq (Michael Gaston), an industrialist whose company is regarded as one of the worst polluters on the planet. As Toller wrestles with his conscience, he comes into conflict with all three in various ways. At the same time, Mary remains virtually the only remnant of hope in his life, as they continue to grow close.

The most striking thing to me about _First Reformed_ is that it is brilliantly shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), and as a result, everything is boxed in, suggesting little room for movement, with very little empty space in the frame. Coupled with this, Schrader is remarkably consistent in composing perfectly symmetrical shots (the opening scene is a good example). Together, the small frame and the symmetrical compositions give one the impression of looking at a confessional, with the priest on one side and the confessor on the other. As Toller's journal entries occur throughout the film in the form of voiceover, this aesthetic replication of a confessional is enhanced even further - although Toller is not the priest hearing the confession, he is the one confessing.

In line with this, _First Reformed_ is not an easy film to watch. It's central themes are suffering, loss of faith, nihilism, and environmental catastrophe, and the way the film is shot, with the added intimacy of the journal, make it seems as if the audience is suffering right alongside Toller; we're drawn completely into his world, and even his mind, in a way very few films achieve. Schrader allows the content to brilliantly dictate the form, with the two becoming so intertwined as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another - a concept most filmmakers don't seem to even understand, let alone have the ability to accomplish. Interestingly this is the second film in the last twelve months to use Academy ratio for explicit narrative reasons, the other being David Lowery's superb _A Ghost Story_ (2017).

Of course, Schrader is as cine-literate as they come, and doesn't make films in isolation (for example, there are at least three explicit visual references to _Taxi Driver_), and looking at First Reformed in relation to his career would require a full article-length study to itself. However, the film in his _oeuvre_ of which I was most reminded was, strangely enough, _Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist_ (2005), which is not especially good, but which does share many of the same narrative beats and thematic concerns - a lost priest whose experiences of the darker side of humanity has led to him questioning his faith; a crisis of conscience; a righteous cause to which he totally gives himself over; an indifferent God watching everything unfold; an unimaginable sacrifice; hope offered in the form of an innocent. _First Reformed_ is a lot better, and a lot more morally complex, but there's certainly a thematic consistency.

However, that is not to say _First Reformed_ is perfect. There are parts where it is extraordinarily clunky. For example, there's the wake where a group of environmentalists start singing an awful cappella version of Neil Young's activist song, ""Who's Gonna Stand up?"", or the scene where Mary and Toller take (figurative) flight through the power of holding hands (in a scene that reminded me of Joel Coen's _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) far more than I would imagine was intended, and got quite a few laughs at the screening I attended).

Additionally, although I've seen many reviews talking about how thought-provoking the environmentalist side of the story is, for me it never really coalesced into anything inherently coherent. Obviously, Toller is a man ready to fall apart when the movie begins, and Michael's concerns about the future of the planet serve as the catalyst for that. However, rather than the film presenting this as nothing more than the backdrop against which Toller's crisis takes place, and thus purposely rendering it unimportant in and of itself, Schrader seems to be trying to genuinely shoehorn in a call-to-action. Which is fairly out of place. And, to be honest, the photograph of the emaciated polar bear is far more disturbing and resonant than any of the facts and figures the film occasionally tosses out.

I'm also not 100% convinced the black comedy worked. There aren't that many instances of it, but when they come, they are so black as to be easily missed. Probably the best example is when Toller is showing a group of children around First Reformed, and telling them how it was a stop on the Underground Railroad, showing them a secret basement in which the runaway slaves would hide. However, instead of simply giving them a quick history lesson, he ends up staring into the basement and giving a graphic description of what it must have been like hiding in the dark, scared and tired, with no room to move. There's a few moments like this, but I didn't think they really sat well with the ultra-realism on display elsewhere.

But they're minor faults, and all things considered, this is a high-quality film. Will it be in contention come awards season? Possibly. Schrader has always had a fraught relationship with the Academy (hard to believe he's never even been nominated for an Oscar), but this is the kind of serious subject matter that voters usually lap up. I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see Hawke get some acting nods, possibly Seyfried too. Irrespective of that (and we all know the amount of Oscar nominations a film gets has very little to do with its quality), this is a strong film made by a skilled artist about a subject matter for which he clearly feels deeply.","**_Brilliantly shot, excellently written_**

11314,"**For the general public, this film is uninteresting. However, it will have merits if displayed within the most correct context.**

I've heard of this film as a documentary, but I honestly don't know if Godfrey Reggio really wanted to document anything. This was the director's debut, and for a first work we can say that there is quality, even though it is a somewhat strange film because it has nothing more than a soundtrack and successive images, which do not seem to have a relationship with each other.

If this is an experimental film, I also can't understand what this director really wanted to experiment with. Making a film without a script and without a story? Honestly, this film looks a lot like those successive images that are sometimes shown in waiting rooms, for whoever is sitting there. And what about the film's title? I honestly thought it was some Croatian or Balkan film before I read something about the film and ventured out to see it. Only then did I discover that it was a term from the Hopi language, and that it means living in an unbalanced way.

Without a defined script, without any actor, without a spoken word (the title is sung in a threatening Gregorian tone at the beginning and at the end, but I consider this part of the soundtrack pure and simple), we just see all the images and the sound of the music. In short, the film seems like a mute critique of the modern way of life, in contrast to what was lived in the past, before industrialization. It's what I think. And a good movie? It will be good as an introduction to the environmental debate, as a reflection film. For the general public who are not interested in debating these issues, it is not worth it.","**For the general public, this film is uninteresting. However, it will have merits if displayed within the most correct context.**

I've heard of this film as a documentary, but I honestly don't know if Godfrey Reggio really wanted to document anything. This was the director's debut, and for a first work we can say that there is quality, even though it is a somewhat strange film because it has nothing more than a soundtrack and successive images, which do not seem to have a relationship with each other.

If this is an experimental film, I also can't understand what this director really wanted to experiment with. Making a film without a script and without a story? Honestly, this film looks a lot like those successive images that are sometimes shown in waiting rooms, for whoever is sitting there. And what about the film's title? I honestly thought it was some Croatian or Balkan film before I read something about the film and ventured out to see it. Only then did I discover that it was a term from the Hopi language, and that it means living in an unbalanced way.

Without a defined script, without any actor, without a spoken word (the title is sung in a threatening Gregorian tone at the beginning and at the end, but I consider this part of the soundtrack pure and simple), we just see all the images and the sound of the music. In short, the film seems like a mute critique of the modern way of life, in contrast to what was lived in the past, before industrialization. It's what I think. And a good movie? It will be good as an introduction to the environmental debate, as a reflection film. For the general public who are not interested in debating these issues, it is not worth it."
11314,"In the Hopi language, this means a mess or a melée and that’s a pretty good description of this ultimate in observational documentaries. It starts and finishes showing us some of the most stunning and striking natural phenomena from the North American continent before gradually dipping its toe into the world of human endeavour. From some of the most impressive features nature created over millennia to some almost as remarkable creations mankind has erected in a tiny percentage of that time. Whilst not on the scale of the Grand Canyon, there are some human feats that are worth acclaiming here as Philip Glass’s score takes us on this tour. Now I didn’t always love that musical commentary. At times it borders on the soporific, but for the most part it goes hand in hand with some cleverly edited imagery depicting how we can be complementary to our planet and how we can be downright hostile to it. A great deal of creative care has gone into the chronology and the photography here as light, shadow, clouds, glass and some effective time-lapse cinematography shows an evolution of the natural, the industrial and the destructive. You do have to wonder if we’d only take greater care of what we have created and live in  a less disposable society, then so much of what we see here that is excessive could be eradicated and our place within the environment of the planet less devastating. It’s a surprisingly effortless watch for ninety minutes and maybe if more saw it, it’s powerful message of striving for greater compatibility might have more impact. I’m not sure the title actually helps on that front. I’ve no idea how to pronounce it, let alone tell folks to watch it - but if you’re reading this and you enjoy big scale drama, then this is hard to beat.","In the Hopi language, this means a mess or a melée and that’s a pretty good description of this ultimate in observational documentaries.

292795,"**Not all the birds born navigator.**

This 'Yellowbird' came between 'Free Birds' and 'Angy Birds'. I liked all the three. They all about the birds, but different from each others. This is a French film in English language. It tells the story of a yellow bird who was raised by a ladybug. All his life he lived in a small safe enclosure, but the destiny chooses him to lead a flock of birds to migrate during the eve of winter. Without any experience how he manages to accomplish the mission is what covered in the remaining parts.

The animation standards were high. The character models and backgrounds, all were impressive. Even the colours and texture were so good. But the story was weak. The adventure did not have any major impressive scene. It has some decent jokes, but not an adventure to define the film. It was a simple story about a lie and doing the right thing after realising that. I am sure not everyone would enjoy it, but kids would.

For me, it had lots of ups and downs throughout the narration. At least it ended decently. Animation films won't release every weekend and I have seen almost all the top ones so far, so what's next are these ones. For the animation fans, this won't be a bad flick if you welcome quality ones, except the story which was just okay. That means it is for the selected viewers.

1172091,"There's something quite fascinating about the recuperative ability of the land to recover from centuries of man's abuse displayed in this documentary. Isabella Tree and husband Charlie have inherited a country estate that can barely manage to grow weeds. The soil is knackered and desperate action is required. They hit on the fairly radical idea of abandoning the place to nature (except their front lawn!) and the film now follows the reclamation of this space by birds, bugs, deer, pigs, cattle - creatures that would have roamed the land freely a few hundred years ago. They even bring in storks! It's a stunning piece of photography to look at, but the underlying narrative is really quite weak and I found it allowed sentiment to overrule the one thing it fails to address - scalability. They live in a castle with no evident money worries. None that we are told about, anyway. So this looks like a worthy pet project that though laudable and impressive will, as one of their neighbours raises at a meeting, not feed the nation. When the vast majority of these complementary farming techniques were in use, the population of the UK was probably less than 10% of what it is now; malnutrition and starvation were rife and distribution methods, without refrigeration, left the food supply subject to the vagaries of the weather. What this doesn't address in any way is just how this method of nurturing the land is going to provide for an hungry population. It's largely presented by Isabella Tree herself, and she is an engaging individual but one who presents the most complex of arguments in far too simple a fashion - as if it were a lecture on the relative merits of organic methods without addressing in any way their limitations of their practicalities or economics. ""Duncan"" the horse and a few of the pigs have some great fun at a charity polo match and it is a very watchable film - but a little too light and fluffy.","There's something quite fascinating about the recuperative ability of the land to recover from centuries of man's abuse displayed in this documentary.

839512,"Told from the perspective of Anita Chitaya, this offers us a cleverly presented counterbalance between this small (one acre) Malawian farmer and her much larger-scale US counterparts. We start in her small rural community where the resources and education are basic, food and water are in short supply and their husbands have the most curious approach to their role as it regards doing any work! Luckily, unlike their friend Winston, her husband does help out now and again but the terrain and the weather conditions really do render this the most subsistence of existences. Wary of the impact climate change is having on their lives, the film crew take her to the United States where they meet some politicians and Iowa farmers who have their own attitudes and problems to deal with. These latter farmers prove much less concerned about the impact of global warming and the challenge for Anita is not only to learn what she can from them, but also to instil in them some semblance of understanding that perhaps, and it is only perhaps, their methods may not be in their own long term interests. That's what made this work better for me. There is no pontificating. No attempt to indoctrinate the audience - we are left to watch, listen and come to our own conclusions. We see Anita's determination, decency and poverty and it starkly contrasts with the livelihoods of her new American friends, but we are also offered a glimpse of their troubles too, as they try to adapt from more ""traditional"" agriculture to more scalable organic methods - without losing their homes and livelihoods along the way. There is a fair degree of Christian faith demonstrated here too - and it is interesting how the differing views on the environmental issues both take some degree of succour from their perceived belief that God wants them to continue... It probably isn't a big screen film, though some of the documentary photography in Malawi is stunning. It is, however, well worth watching on television if you get an opportunity - Anita is an engaging conduit for this important message.","Told from the perspective of Anita Chitaya, this offers us a cleverly presented counterbalance between this small (one acre) Malawian farmer and her much larger-scale US counterparts.

35,"Forgive this forward, but I literally watched all 31 seasons because I was sick and have never understood what the fuss was about the Simpsons.

I really have to conclude that the appeal of the Simpsons was a simple lack of options when it first came out, and then it just grew in power by simply existing for so long.

For this movie:
Uninspired watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend, unless you're already a Simpsons fan.

It's really just a lot of the Simpsons being Simpsons, but that also means that the overall story writing is actually pretty good, even if the character writing is rather repetitive.

I did enjoy the introduction of Ploppers, Spider-Pig, but it doesn't really even out everything else.

The big adversity is an ""under the dome"" scenario, which is actually interesting enough to explore, but because it's the Simpsons, we know that nothing ultimately interesting is going to happen, and that everything is going to resolve like its TV counterpart.  Now, that said, the TV show does drop unexpected, unexplainable shifts, like the death of characters.  I don't think Fox was brave enough to put such a thing in the movie, which would have completely changed the gravity of the movie.

It's fine, it's well produced, it's just not very interesting, and I don't think I'd ever watch it again unless I was binging the Simpsons again, and wanted to watch it in order.","Forgive this forward, but I literally watched all 31 seasons because I was sick and have never understood what the fuss was about the Simpsons.

As I always say when I give films such a bad rating/review (though, tbf, only the ninth time I've rated 1/10...), it is nothing personal and I respect everyone who worked on this film and, of course, understand it isn't easy to make films. I never enjoy slating one, but this... deary me.

I'm not sure where to begin. The dialogue. The dialogue! I genuinely do not believe I've seen a movie with such truly awful dialogue, the amount of times I was holding my head out of cringe was immeasurable. You just know the writer, presumably one Werner Herzog, thought he was prime William Shakespeare when he put it all together. It's not just terrible in itself, it also simply isn't written for the actors - none of it sounds natural out of them whatsoever.

Talking of the actors, they merit some iffiness too. Listen, they are severely hampered by those behind the scenes but more was needed - especially from Michael Shannon, who I am a big fan of but his performance is... questionable, at best. Again, the ill-fitting dialogue did not help. Elsewhere, Veronica Ferres tries and is likeable but... yeah, not good. At least the Arancibia kids add some charm to things.

Those children are put into the film around the middle and somehow (nothing bad on them, just their characters) stay until the very end. Those scenes with them, and Ferres' Laura, are sweet in isolation (pardon the pun), but wow do they feel entirely out of place and disconnected (pardon the p...) to everything that proceeds - to the point that the sweetness drains away.

1/10 always feels harsh to me, yet this is very much deserving of that rating in my opinion. Dire stuff, even at just around 90 minutes. The kids and the neat locations are all I've got by way of positives.","Oof.

Jack Hall is certain that another ice age is imminent due to the effects of global warming, but the government just will not listen to him. Sure enough the climate changes and the world is at threat from perilous frozen weather, worse still for Jack is that his son is trapped in New York City!

Roland Emmerich was the perfect choice to direct this particular piece. There is no denying that he has no little panache when it comes to destroying and blowing things up, think Independence Day, Stargate, Universal Soldier and Godzilla. What runs true through an Emmerich picture is that he is great on the CGI money shots and knows how to whet an appetite for destruction. Sadly, what is also true is that his second halves rarely deliver on their promise, so shall it be with The Day After Tomorrow. Even allowing for the expected mawkishness that comes with disaster/survival pictures, this picture relies too much on its contrivances, thus completely losing sight of its eco-conscious heart, something that I'm sure the politically aware Emmerich set out to deliver at the start.

Packing his picture with solid and professional performers (led by the always watchable Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall), Emmerich is all too aware that his money shots are what the popcorn masses have chiefly paid to see. Tornados, floods and the subsequent freeze are all excellent moments in the piece, but now, some years later the film has to be called out for being the shallow showcase that it is, in fact the CGI looks unintentionally artificial. It's a missed opportunity to make a blockbuster with an intelligent heart, and sadly Emmerich, either through boredom or ignorance? failed to seal the deal and craft one of the better genre entries.

Just about average for the destruction sequences, but very little else to recommend here I'm afraid. 5/10","It threatened and promised to be a  politically (wooly) mammoth disaster picture.

Jack Hall is certain that another ice age is imminent due to the effects of global warming, but the government just will not listen to him. Sure enough the climate changes and the world is at threat from perilous frozen weather, worse still for Jack is that his son is trapped in New York City!

Roland Emmerich was the perfect choice to direct this particular piece. There is no denying that he has no little panache when it comes to destroying and blowing things up, think Independence Day, Stargate, Universal Soldier and Godzilla.

I would be sad if my political or social stances Completely prevented me from being able to appreciate films that stretch credulity the opposite way from my own views. I mean, I am an ardent atheist and have enjoyed religious films. I am all for science, but science fiction can take a few liberties and shortcuts and if I like it, I will suspend my disbelief. But many people automatically hate what they disagree with.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, as I like extreme weather and other disaster special effects in films. I didn't feel insulted by the perceived intelligence of the plot and dialogue as others seemed to be. I don't watch feature films for the latest information on climate change: the news and documentaries are around for that. The special effects were good enough and - okay — scenes like the quick freezing dropping from the atmosphere is probably total hokey, but it serves the rapid pace of the plot. The idea of what happens with Mexico at the end seems a little heavy handed politically, but I don’t have delicate sensibilities in the political arena, so fine. Yada yada yada: Just entertain me.

435,"**The Day After Tomorrow ends the world better than most natural disaster films, with an experienced disaster director and a grounded premise.**

Roland Emmerich, the master of disaster, created one of the quintessential apocalyptic natural disaster films with The Day After Tomorrow. Floods, tsunamis, hail, suddenly dropping temperatures, and more all make their way into the perils of this film. The movie follows Dennis Quaid's climatologist as he warns the world of a quickly returning ice age. Once the global freeze catches humanity unprepared, survivors struggle against the impossible temperatures to find shelter and hope. The film sets itself apart with its cinematography featuring the expansive frozen wastelands and iconic monuments captured in ice. Performances are solid with a cast like Quaid, Gyllenhaal, and Rossum. The story is simple, which works for a disaster survival flick. The Day After Tomorrow is special compared to other big-budget catastrophe events because it is a little more grounded compared to some of the more outrageous films of Emmerich's more recent filmography, like Moonfall or 2012 but still benefits from a director that excels at destroying historic landmarks on the big screen.","**The Day After Tomorrow ends the world better than most natural disaster films, with an experienced disaster director and a grounded premise.**

568160,"Weathering with You unfortunately doesn't live up to the masterpiece that is Your Name, but still delivers a heartfelt story with brilliant animation.

Many complain that they had trouble connecting with this story on an emotional level, and while I understand that complaint I slightly disagree. I think this story does a fine job at really making you care about the characters. The journey you take with them from poverty to some modicum of financial success is endearing and makes that tightknit family easy to root for. Where the story fails are in the details, mainly why Kataro Daigo ran away from home in the first place. What trials and tribulations led him down this path and why he is so hesitant to return? This small detail could have gone a long way to further that connection to the character. The overall story is fantastic, and while it has some very similar beats to Your Name, it does enough to differentiate itself. All the characters are unique, and their outcast natures makes them have a super close bound that makes each emotional moment that much harder. While the ending may be divisive, it delivered a sucker punch to my stomach drawing a tear from my eye.

The animation style is gorgeous once again, with this film allowing the artists to flex their weather animation effects to the max. So many rainy scenes were so incredibly detailed with reflections that seem too real for a simple 2D animation. I do think the film lacks a bit in diverse landscapes as it mainly focuses on the city of Tokyo, whereas Your Name spans from Tokyo to the Japanese countryside.

Overall, Weathering with You is an excellent addition to Makoto Shinkai's filmography. It is heartfelt, emotional, and an endearing story about struggle, family, and making the most of every moment. While it may not exceed its predecessor, it is still one of the better anime films I have ever seen.

646380,"This is of course social and political satire, and it is sad how much of it rings true. It can be difficult to satirize the excesses of the rich and famous — or even the redneck poor — and the social media juggernaut.

But the script clicks on all cylinders a lot of the time and entertains as it eviscerates. I have always liked Mark Ryland’s roles, and this is a real departure for him as the media giant and third richest human ever. But I mostly found it difficult to like Dr. Mindy as he gradually adjusts his beliefs and personality to suit his new fame. My sympathy was with his wife and family, afterthoughts for 95% of the movie.

But it was an entertaining movie and I would be willing to watch it again someday, not because of the serious issues it raised (slightly) but just to catch more of the social media and television images that flash across the screen too quickly to take them all in. The social media satire works better, I think, than the political side, which seemed sometimes to just choose an actual person and thrust a version of them into the scene.","This is of course social and political satire, and it is sad how much of it rings true.

Using some phenomenal archive photography of the realm beneath the sea, Sir David Attenborough narrates a story of devastation, desperation and ultimately optimism as he takes us on a journey around the globe evaluating the damage caused to the Earth’s oceans by a mankind who has treated this vast resource with contempt ever since industrialisation enabled us to ignore the protective forces of nature and pretty much fish at will. Some of the imagery here is truly breathtaking. It’s beautiful, colourful and vibrant with creatures that look every inch as if they came straight out of science fiction. It’s not just the sheer variety of life that we see that takes your breath away, though. The effects of the trawlers scarifying the scallop beds or the coral reefs renders them akin to a waste ground after a bomb has been dropped on it. The ruin is profound and quite frankly upsetting. Our continuing reliance on cheap and abundant food for ourselves and our pets is compromising the very existence of species that have existed in harmony with nature (and even humanity) for millennia. In his usually potent but understated manner, Sir David makes his points without resort to hyperbole and superlatives and as he lays out the scale of this problem before us he offers us hope that there is still time, should we take a longer-term view, for us to leave well alone and allow this crucial part of the planet’s infrastructure to recover and assist with the fight against global warming. The message is clear as a bell, but it isn’t laboured by the dialogue. It is illustrated by odd looking crabs, seahorses and magnificent blue whales. The production is top class and as an educational piece of cinema, this will take some beating - especially if you can catch it all on a big screen.","This is one of those films that really does resonate.

You get the impression it's a pretty mundane existence and maybe not have been the strongest of relationships when a stranger in what looks like an old De Lorean arrives. It turns out that ""Terrance"" (Aaron Pierre) has come from the supra-governmental agency that's in charge of populating space - yep, the planet is on it's last legs - and that ""Junior"" has been selected to go live upstairs leaving is wife behind. No chance says ""Junior"", no choice says ""Terrance"" but there is some silver lining for ""Hen"". They will make her a carbon copy of her husband to ""keep her company"" whilst he is away. To that end, their visitor must remain for a few weeks to gather information on every intimate detail of their lives together so that ""Junior 2"" can be as authentic as possible. Now we don't actually know this, but it's safe to assume that somewhere in the ensuing proceedings, there is a body swap otherwise the rather dreary and drawn out denouement would make even less sense that it actually does. Is this suppose to be a crit on the nature of human relationships, or of the human psyche? If you went to bed at night and awoke to an identical partner that had been swapped in the night, would you even know? That's the problem. It's a complete non-story that limbers towards it's conclusion without really engaging on any level. That said, man-of-the-moment Mescal does turn in an emotional performance at times, but Ronan is really rather wasted here and the thinly developed characterisation of ""Terrance"" just further consigns this to the doldrums of what looks a short story laggardly dragged out for all but two hours.

900379,"Fire is a force that can destroy and devastate, but it’s also one thar can cleanse, sweeping away what’s of questionable value in order to clear space for robust, vigorous, valued new growth. And, sometimes, it can do both simultaneously, as demonstrated in writer-director Christian Petzold’s latest, a searing drama/wry comedy about four old/newfound friends who are unwittingly drawn together at a summer house near the Baltic seacoast. Their time together proves revelatory, stressful and enlightening, in part because of their interactions, the disclosures that come out of those relationships, and the looming threat of ravaging forest fires that threaten them and their existence, both literally and metaphorically. The film is a slowburn in every sense of the word, especially at the outset, with a somewhat cryptic narrative that seems rather meandering at times, but that sets the stage for what’s to follow in the back half. The picture subsequently presents a witty but profoundly insightful examination of what makes us who we are, how much we enjoy or endure our lives, and what we can do to make it better for ourselves when we eliminate what no longer serves us. In many respects, “Afire” is probably not what most viewers will expect, but, then, that’s a huge part of its appeal, a refreshing, engaging look at life and what we make of it, a valuable exercise given how abruptly it can all be taken away, leaving us to ask ourselves, what did we do with the time we had and was it indeed worth it in the end? Give this one time to unfold, and let it sink in. It may help you realize and understand more about yourself than you can possibly imagine.","Fire is a force that can destroy and devastate, but it’s also one thar can cleanse, sweeping away what’s of questionable value in order to clear space for robust, vigorous, valued new growth.

The characterisations here have a fluidity to them that makes for quite an interesting watch. None of them could ever be described as beautiful - in any classical sense - so the story is much more about their traits, flaws and foibles than about their looks.

664280,"The thing that makes this documentary so inspiring is that it is not a lecture. Sir David Attenborough demonstrates through his wealth of experience over the years, the chronology of the decline of the natural world without preaching to us. The beautiful imagery accumulated over 50 years of natural history film-making coupled with a considered, poignant and practical analysis of where we were/are and want to be offers stark warnings, certainly, but also scope for hope and optimism too if only we can get a grip. His manner is affable and authoritative, he is the teacher every one of would have loved to have had - and perhaps, had we, things wouldn't look quite so ominous! The photography - particularly the archive - is gorgeous to look at and underscores perfectly the points he is making, and the global perspective he takes gives this a currency far and away more valuable and penetrating than any politically driven assessment. It's a wonderful film that everyone ought to see. It also serves as a fitting testament to the visionary people at the BBC (often together with WGBH) who created these documentaries over many, many years - providing an essential spine for this narrative, but also so much of my own understanding of how the planet works. It is a shame that the BBC is now heading for a similar extinction level event; with - sadly - very few ready to take up the cudgels on it's behalf.","The thing that makes this documentary so inspiring is that it is not a lecture.

Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is produced and directed by Irwin Allen out of 20th Century Fox. The story was written by Irwin Allen and Charles Bennett and it stars Walter Pidgeon, Robert Sterling, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden, Michael Ansara, and Peter Lorre. The theme song was sung by Frankie Avalon, who also appears in the film. Winton Hoch is the cinematographer and the score is a joint collaboration by Paul Sawtell & Bert Shefter. It's a CinemaScope/De Luxe presentation.

Admiral Harriman Nelson (Pidgeon) is commander of his new, state of the art nuclear submarine, The Seaview, which is on diving trials in the Arctic Ocean. When the sub surfaces the crew find the sky is burning, it seems that a meteor shower had occurred and a piece has fractured the Van Allen Radiation Belt causing it to catch fire, the result of which is a world-threatening increase in heat all across the Earth. Nelson proposes to the U.N. to detonate a Polaris nuclear missile in the belt to hopefully send it on a reverse spin into outer space. However, his idea is shot down at the meeting and he decides to take matters into his own hands. Setting off for the calculated launching point in the Marianas Trench, the crew of The Seaview must tackle terrors of the deep, pursuing hostile submarines and severe in fighting as the crew start to come apart under pressure.

To those of us who were reared on pre Star Wars sci-fi it's hard to grasp the complaints of the modern audience about old time genre movies and the effects that reside within. Before George Lucas took sci-fi and cinema watching to a different level involving pacey action every other frame, explosions a plenty and money inspired effects: our tastes were happily catered for by solid stories, character development and the odd bit of inspired for its time effects. Enter Irwin Allen's ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" which boasts all those latter points mentioned.

That the film was turned into a television series that ran for 5 seasons (64-68) is arguably the biggest legacy. For at the time of its release the critics gave it a very mixed response, and yet the public made it a hit. Made for roughly $2 million it comfortably made $7 million at the box office to justify Allen's faith in the movie. Watching it now as an adult it has lost none of the charm it had for me as a child. Only differences now are that I can sensibly think about such things as the science involved, observe a cheeky pro-nuclear stance in the Cold War era, and of course admire the form of Barbara Eden in a way I wouldn't have done as a spotty faced kid!.

It's now also a film, thanks to the advent of home entertainment technology, that looks and sounds great. There's plenty of De Luxe colour eye candy visuals, some vintage effects and good quality underwater photography. The production design holds up well, while The Seaview itself, with its on board aquarium and unique eight-window bow view port, remains an indelible piece of sci-fi folklore. The acting isn't called on to be much, but they all deliver professional turns, while Avalon's title song is a catchy piece of harmony. All that and you also get Peter Lorre brooding and taking a shark for a walk!.

Anyway, they quickly decide to take it upon themselves to destroy some remote pipeline infrastructure and with the help of the internet and some stump remover, they manage to construct some pretty lethal IEDs and set their plan in motion. Depending on your politics, I suspect you will either love the efforts of these courageous eco-warriors or you will see them as little more than self-appointed judge and jury for the rest of us. Whilst my jury was intrigued at the start, the increasingly underwhelming nature of the personas collected here gradually made me consider whether or not I would ever want any aspect of my future (or anyone else's) in the hands of these people. The last twenty minutes is quite well put together but I did struggle with the roles attributed to the FBI agent and the local police officer. Is it daring or is it reckless?

288789,"> Beware of the wolves in the sheepskins.

I want to begin with what usually comes in the final paragraph in any review that it is a must see film. No matter who you are, whatever your profession is, you must not skip it for many reasons. The film was based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Naomi Oreskes and directed by the Oscar nominated documentary 'Food, Inc.' filmmaker.

Recently I read somewhere that 'there are more fake flamingos in the world than real ones'. I thought it was a stat that makes clear there are very less flamingos than we presumed. But the point is it gives a different meaning when the same line used as a reference for this film. It is going to be big stride, yes it is. It all began after the WWII and carried out throughout 50 years during the Cold War, but just recent decades everyone realised its seriousness.

When someone interferes with our personal thing, stating that he's an official from the respective field, we ask for the identity proof. But what if it is a conspiracy, how we are going to know it. The common people are always falling prey for such tricks because of the corrupted ministers and the powerful giant corporates. Like, we're the sheep herd and they are the wolves in the sheep's skin. This film is not trying to expose them their entire wrong doings, but on a particular topic, and that is the Global Warming.

The media and press plays a crucial part here, but some of them opted a wrong path. Maybe because of the poor knowledge and investigation, or influenced people around them. So the story opens with the cigarettes, how the tobacco companies fooled people in the 60s, 70s till the 90s. The book this movie adapted was written by an American historian, so it's all about the things that happened in the States. But it is still very much the world's concern too, as America is one of the top countries to export modern science and technology to all the corners, especially the third world countries.

> ""We're leaving our children and grandchildren,
> the legacy of people who failed to lead.""

Today's world's hot topic is, the climate change. Because of human there are plenty of species gone extinct than the natural extinct happened in the presence of human alongside. So, the biggest them all is he's posing a same threat to himself. If that happens, the human will be wiped out. The earth will recycle itself over the thousand years of evolution and the life will be restored, the new kind. Human is the only animal on the earth who do stuff for pleasure and those pleasures comes in many ways. One such thing is the money.

Science is not one hundred per cent perfect, not yet, but that is the closest estimation that we have today to predict anything advancely. The world is not the same compared to 100 years ago, the religion is no more threat to the science. The evolution in science is taking place at a brisk pace, lots of stuffs were studied, understood, discovered in the last two decades than over two thousand years. Those who are doing their work is constantly interrupted by the new kind of troublemakers. Those people are the hired counterparts to the scientists who claims they are experts, but why they are doing it is a disgusting truth.

It is a very good message movie. You might probably realise from now on who to believe and why, because that was this documentary's notion that makes people open their eyes to the truth and reality. If you're still in your blindfold, then you're on the wrong side with the wrong people. I want to make you clear on one final thing that this documentary is not trying to prove the Global Warming theory, but it was a debate between the people who tried to stop it and the people who tried to prove it was not a hoax. It is about exposing the dirty works.

This is a really interesting documentary about the difficulties of Everest. There are many ways that you can tell an interesting story about the highest point on Earth and this one comes from the perspective of the Sherpa and their quest to de-trash the mountain.

It's very matter-of-fact with most of the camera work on the ascent being shot on GoPro's worn by the Sherpa themselves. It totally works and Patrick Stewart's narration does a good job filling in any gaps. The Sherpa themselves are interesting and give us a great perspective on their experience.

It's a great watch for people who appreciate the environment and are interested in being a good steward. It's illuminating to see exactly what the climbers see and understand the risks of their lifestyle. Would recommend!","I believe this has gotten a re-release with Patrick Stewart providing the narration--although I'm not 100% sure.

​""Le Choix De Sofia--which translates Sophie's Choice--finds its more ""progressive"" heroine confronted with a less horrific choice to her 1982 predecessor (in Meryl Streep), but a slow-burning and soul-destroying one nevertheless; one that much like Naomi Klein's famous quote disclaims upon the film's commencement, requires a total suspension of one's moral belief infrastructure at the expense of one's survival in a highly capitalist Matrix.
   Alain Deslongchamps triumphs in his architectural sculpting of a world that engulfs Sofia into unsustainable materialism, clinical corporate panorama and ultimately a self-confined solitary existence devoid of socio-emotional connection.
   Véronique Gallant sophisticatedly peels off Sofia's facade of a self-reliant and efficient business matriarch and workaholic, whose secret inferiority complex at the hands of her inexperienced male colleagues, ultimately lead her down a downward spiral that sees her cancel on her girlfriends and work into the night on an already-immaculate report. Le Choix De Sofia's finds unquestionable high-class achievements in both its intricate character- and world-building; it's in the film's overall tempo-rhythmic and editorial assemblage that Deslongchamps's tale of corporate dystopia implores the same level of minutiae and omnipresence to take this short spectacle all the way into stratosphere.   
   Deslongchamps's directorial vision for the film is one of a parallel-canvas where Sofia's soul being is slowly deteriorated and climactically collapses, just like the Arctic's melting ice caps; it's through tv background noise, channel surfing and a surrealistic dream-sequence that Deslongchamps brings us to his metaphoric terrain, but the results have a tendency to feel over-pressed in the third act and undercooked for the entire audiovisual entendre. Deslongchamps's original intent is for a lighthearted and understated dramedy, which is an ascertained choice, but a sprinkle of Sofia's interiority for a more nail-bitting spectatorial experience (in the style of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010) and Emma Seligman's Shiva Baby (2020)) would have up the film's stakes and climate change socio-economic impact.
   Deslongchamps's directorial ambition and tenacity here place him on the map and en-route on an exciting and prosperous career trajectory. Le Choix De Sofia exhibits a magnetic lead in Véronique Gallant wrapped in a most gorgeous cinematographic canvas presentation.""","LE CHOIX DE SOFIA ★★★★

1255,"This is a monster horror movie that really tries, to the point where they don’t give a clear view of the creature in the previews, presumably not to ruin the initial shock moment for the viewer. It is in Korean with English subtitles, with a few bursts of English with Korean subtitles when the speaker is American.

The movie focuses on one family’s ongoing battle: not merely against the monster but also struggling against the authorities who want to capture them, suspecting they have been infected with a virus by coming in contact with the creature.

The dialogue is pretty ordinary. I seem to recall a few unintentionally funny moments, though I cannot say for sure that it wasn’t due to the translation. I don’t intend to be hyper critical here: I sort of let the movie wash over me to get to the end, and you may or may not need to do the same.

I found I was a little confused as to the final fate of one of the family members at the end. Perhaps I was inattentive and it would have been cleared up if I backed it up and watched again, but unfortunately I wasn’t quite inversted in the movie enough to do that. I put in my time and that was sufficient unto the day.","This is a monster horror movie that really tries, to the point where they don’t give a clear view of the creature in the previews, presumably not to ruin the initial shock moment for the viewer.

552178,"Great, but it should have been a series instead of a movie

Dramatic movie based on true events taken from The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare and this New York Times article. The story of the movie is about a corporate defense attorney named Robert Billet, who filed an environmental lawsuit against a giant chemical company, with time discovering a long way from pollution.

A dramatic and humane movie that you will enjoy watching if you are a fan of investigative investigations, but it is heavy if you are a fan of light movies, but it is dramatic and controversial. After watching the movie, I felt that my entire soul was polluted and poisoned, and I was almost afraid that my clothes were all full of radiation. It was a shocking thing for me.

We have seen what humans do in certain things they make and don't think about their consequences even if they know their consequences. There are companies that do not care about any of the creatures on the planet, only seeking and crawling for money.

There have been films similar to Dark Waters such as A Civil Action 1998 by John Travolta and Erin Brockovich 2000 by Julia Roberts.

This movie, which contains destruction, pollution, and damage, harms a frightening number of living creatures. The movie portrayed major companies as a scary monster that devours humanity and living creatures, even seaweed.

I loved Mark Ruffalo in this movie. He played the role of a person who makes huge sacrifices in order to reveal the truth. He waited 15 years for the American judiciary to issue the final ruling in the case, and we saw how big and giant companies rule the country regardless of the law. Mark Ruffalo's acting was strong and I liked it, but it doesn't reach the perfection that deserves an Oscar.


Bill Camp impressed me the most in this movie. He could be an Oscar star. His scenes were powerful and breathtaking, and the pain was heart-wrenching.

The sequence of the story and events was somewhat flopped at the beginning of the movie, sometimes it becomes interesting and sometimes it becomes boring. I understand that the story is long and its events took place over a period of years. I think it is worth making a series for this instead of a movie, in order to see a more coherent story.

I don't think that Dark Waters deserves an Oscar, but it deserves to be nominated for an Oscar, and it is a good drama movie, and I wish it would be done in the form of a series","Great, but it should have been a series instead of a movie

13006,"We are not chasing it, it's chasing us.

Split Second is directed by Tony Maylam and Ian Sharp and written by Gary Scott Thompson. It stars Rutger Hauer, Kim Cattrall and Neil Duncan. It was filmed in London, England, predominantly at the Hartley Jam Factory in Southwark, with Clive Tickner the cinematographer.

London, 2008. 

""After forty days and nights of torrential rain, the city is largely submerged below water, a result of the devastating effects of continued global warming. The warnings ignored for decades have now resulted in undreamed of levels of pollution where day has become almost endless night..."" 

and something is stalking the watery city and tearing hearts out of its victims...

Plot follows a familiar course, and in truth there's no surprises here. A psychic link between Stone and the killer is sadly never fully formed, which is a shame because it had the potential to make the film more interesting. To offset that though, is that there is some nice babble involving astrological and satanic matters which are thrown up during the search/investigation. In its favour as well, is that Maylam and his team sensibly keep the perpetrator hidden for most of the film, instead choosing the odd flashing glimpse of a clawed hand, or a murky torso running across the frame, while the idea to only show the bloody aftermath of a kill hits home harder than if we had actually viewed it.

The look is spot on for an apocalyptic sci-fi piece, all greys, silvers and low lights, while the cheap production design works well in context of the tone of the picture. There's even some Schwarzenegger like cheese dialogue, the likes of which the big Austrian would have got paid millions to speak at around the same time Split Second was released. The killer, once revealed, will disappoint many, mainly because it looks overly familiar, but it does impact for the finale set at a flooded tube station. While the music (co-scored by three different people) is ideal as it sounds very tinny, in fact it's very 1980's like.

Judging by the critical reaction to it you have to think some folk were taking it a bit too seriously. Never fully convincing as a lead man, Hauer pitches this just right, with tongue in cheek, a grizzled personage and a swagger to match the glint in is eyes. He's playing a burned out cop character called Harley Stone, his partner, who of course is the polar opposite, is named Dick Durkin! Take this seriously? Never! Cattrall is merely here to be a love interest, to scream and show some flesh for the discerning hound dog, while her haircut, some black dyed German Helmet effort, is totally unflattering. Duncan does a fine job as the nerdy copper, working the comedy off of Hauer very well, while fleeting support comes from great British actors Alun Armstrong and Pete Postlethwaite. In cameos we get song man Ian Dury and Michael J. Pollard.

Leave the brain at the door and you have a good chance of enjoying this low-budget British sci-fier. 7/10","We are not chasing it, it's chasing us.

29343,"Rapist Creatures from the Black Lagoon 

This Roger Corman production was released in 1980 and concerns a northern California fishing community beset by humanoid marine creatures intent on killing the dudes and having sex with the ladies. It’s as if the creatures say: ""Where all dem white wimmens at?"" Doug McClure plays the lead protagonist, Jim Hill, while Anthony Pena is on hand as a persecuted Indian, Johnny Eagle.

The monsters aren’t too far removed from the Gill-man from “Creature from the Black Lagoon” (1954), albeit with big heads, sharp teeth, loong arms and huge tails. The setting and tone is similar to the contemporaneous “Prophecy” (1979) and “The Fog” (1980), except that “Humanoids from the Deep” throws in the rape angle and female nudity, mostly top nudity, but one woman on the beach is shown fully nude.

Speaking of the women, curvy Cindy Weintraub stands out as Jim Hill’s wife, as does voluptuous Lynn Theel, both uniquely attractive (don’t expect boring thin blondes with fake breasts). There are a couple of other notable cuties. Meanwhile towering Ann Turkel plays the requisite marine scientist.

The “shocking” tacked-on epilogue is well done, but it rips off “Alien” (1979). Been there, done that (and done better).

The movie runs 1 hour, 20 minutes and was shot in the Fort Bragg area of Northern California. It was remade in 1996 with Emma Samms and Robert Carradine.

Tom McHugh (Doug) and Constance Shulman (Patti) are alright in their respective roles, though Fred Newman is kinda annoying as Skeeter. The film doesn't do anything to make you actually care for the characters, so I can cut the cast some slack in that regard.

828146,"Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet understands that it’s not the planet, but the human race that must be saved, and the only way to do that is to study how the planet works (know your enemy, perhaps?).

As Swedish professor Johan Rockström says, “biodiversity is not something we need to protect due to some kind of moral responsibility of one species, humans, towards another species such as flora and fauna”, but because “it is the toolbox for the functioning of our societies.”

Rockström is a proponent of Planetary Boundaries, a conceptual framework that assesses the state of nine processes fundamental to the stability of the Earth system, and suggests a series of thresholds for these processes that, if overcome, can endanger the habitability of the planet.

These thresholds are one-way doors; once crossed, there is no going back. Greenland, for example, is apparently fubar, as are half the corals in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.

Rockström is Swedish, and that’s the only thing he has in common with Greta Thunberg. While she is a shrill, sanctimonious, self-righteous, malnourished bitch on wheels, Rockström is calm, cool and collected (by the way, the documentary is hosted by David Attenborough, a paragon of avuncular bonhomie); furthermore, Rockström actually sounds like he knows what he’s talking about, and is much easier to take seriously.

Additionally, Rockström demonstrates a deep understanding of human nature; accordingly, he cuts to the chase and appeals to people’s selfishness as a catalyst for change. And why not? He’s aware that the average a--hole never listens to the science anyway.","Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet understands that it’s not the planet, but the human race that must be saved, and the only way to do that is to study how the planet works (know your enemy, perhaps?).

18274,"**_Lazy pre-""Jaws"" nature-nuns-amok flick_**  

Myriad swamp creatures (frogs, snakes, alligators, lizards, scorpions, tarantulas, crabs, etc.) vengefully attack a crotchety old man's Southern mansion in the swamp. Apparently, they’re hopping mad about the toxic chemicals used to exterminate them, not to mention pollutants in general. The film stars Ray Milland as the old grump, a mustache-less Sam Elliott and a young Joan Van Ark.

""Frogs"" (1972) predates ""Jaws"" by a few years. The creators were obviously going for a swamp version of the basic ""The Birds"" plot. The difference is that ""The Birds"" is a first-rate flick whereas ""Frogs"" is second rate, which isn’t to say that it’s unprofessional or that there aren’t points of interest. Any fan of nature-runs-amok flicks should find something to like. The film gives you what you pay for: Real swamp locations with real swamp creatures horrifyingly attacking and killing people, not to mention a grand antebellum mansion and grounds.

The best thing is that the story is taken seriously. There's no silliness or camp to be seen as in, say, ""Lake Placid"" or ""Crocodile"" (2000). Another highlight is Joan Van Ark who’s quite fetching at 28 during shooting. Lynn Borden and Judy Pace are also worth mentioning in the feminine department. On the other side of the gender spectrum, there’s Elliott, who’s excellent as the low-key macho protagonist, as well as Adam Roarke and David Gilliam, amongst others.

The main problem with “Frogs” is that there isn't any suspense; the tone is curiously lazy. But if you're a fan of creatures-on-the-loose films or any of the cast members then you'll probably find something to appreciate. It has more originality than the many post-""Jaws"" flicks and there are indeed a few horrifying parts. Just don't expect a Class A film like ""The Birds"" or much suspense and you won't be disappointed.

For any who complain that the name of the movie is inaccurate in light of the fact that there are various bog creatures attacking the people, not just frogs, think about it like this: The frogs are like little Napoléons sending their soldiers into the fray. 

It runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely at Eden Gardens State Park, Florida, which is located on the panhandle 20 miles west of Panama City.

As some of you might know, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2019. Not because I expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who I would immensely care about. I was incredibly excited because it’s freaking Godzilla and from the few images that I had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. I didn’t need an Oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. I just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. So, my expectations were neither complex or as high as some other people might have.

Unfortunately, I left the theater extremely disappointed. I can’t deny the impeccable VFX and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. Some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. However, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. I wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding Game Of Thrones, and I will stand by it. I’m always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if I have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, I have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice.

Ultimately, that’s the huge problem here. The screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes I’ve seen in the last few years. Characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. Generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it’s not the most intelligent decision. King of the Monsters has all of these types and more! More?! Seriously, Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom.

I yawned during a Godzilla blockbuster. Yawned. How sad is that?! I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards’ 2014’s Godzilla. At the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn’t enough Godzilla in it. Most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. King of the Monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. In the first installment, even though I also wanted more Godzilla, when he actually shows up, I was so freaking excited! Since I had to wait for the third act to watch the Titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy.

This sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. There are a lot of fight sequences, and I wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. The dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. On one hand, you can’t have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. On the other hand, you can’t have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes.

King of the Monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. No one wants to have back-to-back fights because they’ll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy PowerPoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. I can’t even remember the main characters’ names, and I watched the movie yesterday! I can’t blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. Millie Bobby Brown (Madison Russell) continues her path to become one of Hollywood’s biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she’ll have an Oscar in her hands, I guarantee you that). Kyle Chandler (Mark Russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and Ken Watanabe (Dr. Ishiro Serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance AND had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). Vera Farmiga (Dr. Emma Russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by Emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters.

They had five years to write a straightforward narrative with simple characters. No fan neither wanted or needed a brilliant, groundbreaking screenplay. Dougherty and Shields delivered one of the worst scripts of the year, one filled with exposition, cliche characters, and a runtime that turned out to be way too long for someone to tolerate all of the dreadful dialogue. I don’t know if it will clearly end up as one of the worst films of 2019, but it’s definitely one of the biggest letdowns. All in all, Godzilla: King of the Monsters didn’t meet my expectations (and mine were pretty fair), not even close. Visually, it’s one of the most striking movies I’ve seen this year, and that can’t be dismissed. From the massive fights with the Titans to the impressive wide shots, Dougherty had a gorgeous diamond that he just needed to polish with a rational and simplistic story, like it was a soft, clean cloth. Instead, he used a hammer…

>_And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, ""Arise, devour much flesh."" After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, whic__h had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns._

- Daniel 7:3-7

>_Behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth_ [...] _And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea_ [...] _And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, ""Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?""_ [...] _And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world._

I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards's 2014 _Godzilla_. Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper-thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. As Edwards had already proved with his debut film, the superb _Monsters_ (2010) and as he would subsequently prove with _Rogue One: A Star Wars Story_ (2016), he has a knack for wedding large-scale CGI grandiosity to stories that feel contemplative and personalised. And I don't care how long this franchise may run, and how many films get churned out, Godzilla's mic-drop moment, when he holds the female MUTO's mouth open and breathes blue fire down its throat will never be topped in its ""holy shit""-ness. Ironically enough though, what I admired most about the film is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting; it took over an hour before we first saw him, and then he got only seven minutes total screen time. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. Remember when Hulk Hogan was the WWF champion for three years running? He didn't wrestle on every show, he didn't even appear on every show. So when Wrestlemania came around, and we knew the Hulkster would be headlining, it meant more than if we'd just seen him the week prior. Same thing with _Godzilla_. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called _Godzilla_ featured so little, well, Godzilla!

The third film in Legendary Entertainment's ""MonsterVerse"" franchise, _King of the Monsters_ is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he doesn't return as director), and sets up Adam Wingard's _Godzilla vs. Kong_, which has already wrapped shooting, and is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty (_Trick 'r Treat_; _Krampus_) essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre for pretty much the entire runtime (there are four big fight scenes within the first half-hour alone), and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. Indeed, he told Collider, ""_I would call it the_ Aliens _to Gareth's_ Alien."" And although Dougherty isn't half the director that Edwards is, _King of the Monsters_ works pretty well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clichés abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish, and you really can't fault a film for succeeding at its primary objective.

Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world, all in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is the private company Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's _Kong: Skull Island_, which took place in 1973). As the film begins, Monarch employees Dr. Ishirô Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), both returning from the previous film, are attempting to convince the Senate that under no circumstances should control of the Titans be turned over to the military, something with which Admiral William Stenz (the great David Strathairn, also returning from the first film) strongly disagrees. Meanwhile, in China, paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant ""alpha signal"" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed ""Monster Zero"", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.

With production wrapping on _King of the Monsters_ in 2017, and with two release dates scrapped, the film was beginning to accrue some pretty bad buzz. Then that magisterial first trailer dropped, showing Mothra spanning her glorious wings scored with a remix of Claude Debussy's ""Clair de Lune"" from _Suite bergamasque_ (1890) and promising a film of pensive apocalyptic goings-on. It was the sort of trailer to turn even the biggest naysayer around. The good news is that all the best bits from the trailer are in the film. The bad news is that most of the best bits from the film are in the trailer.

Godzilla was originally created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishirô Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya, and first seen on screen in 1954's _Gojira_ (released in North America in 1956 as _Godzilla, King of the Monsters!_, a reedited version of the original with additional scenes and new actors). Over the last six decades, he has appeared in all manner of films and TV shows, from action flicks to eco-metaphors to kid's cartoons to comedy to whatever the hell Roland Emmerich's 1998 version was. Conceived in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the Daigo Fukuryū Maru incident, Godzilla was intended as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. Thematically speaking, the highpoint of the ""Kaiju"" (Japanese for ""strange beast"") genre thus far is probably Hideaki Anno's _Shin Gojira_ (2016), which was a political satire inspired by the Japanese government's response to the 2011 Tôhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.

_King of the Monsters_ has one eye on its themes too (a dire warning of oncoming eco-disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising, exposition-heavy script by Dougherty and Zach Shields, from a story by Max Borenstein, is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. Traditionally, Godzilla is inherently benevolent. However, in the 2014 version, Edwards muddied this concept brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In _King of the Monsters_, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and they wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.

And yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. Jonah, of course, believes that giving the earth back to the Titans is all humanity deserves, and is exactly what the planet needs (it's revealed early in the film that the Titans leave behind biomatter which results in the rapid growth of vegetation). For her part, Emma compares humanity to a virus, and the Titans to a ""fever"" that could eradicate it. Elsewhere, obviously with one eye on the issue of American isolationism under Trump, as well as the unstable geopolitical situation, Serizawa states, ""_sometimes, the only way to heal a wound is to make peace with the demon who caused it_"". The problem with all of this is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clichéd old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.

As we're discussing the script, another problem is repetition. For example, on several occasions, Godzilla is getting his ass handed to him, only to make an 'unexpected' comeback, whilst not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. There are also some hideous clichés. At one point, on their flagship the ARGO, the Monarch people are listening to Godzilla's heartbeat, which is becoming weaker and weaker, and Dr. Rick Stanton (a criminally underused Bradley Whitford) implores, all earnest-like, ""_c'mon big guy_."" It's supposed to be a moment of great pathos, tapping into the audience's empathy for Godzilla. Instead, at the screening I attended, everyone laughed, so clunky and self-serious was the moment. 

Another scene that doesn't work, although in a completely different way, is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera not even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word ""Deceased"" written underneath. Not exactly the best way to handle a major death. There's also a (predictable) twist based on what could charitably be called ill-defined character motivations. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Kyle Chandler, he has precious little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another, oftentimes even narrating their motivations. In any case, not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional, with not a hint of interiority amongst the lot of them. Additionally, because the scale of the fights is so massive, and the humans so poorly written, Dougherty is unable to make the characters seem even remotely significant. This was another area where Edwards did well, marrying the spectacle with smaller human drama, but Dougherty allows the spectacle to overwhelm everything else.

There are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes. From Colorado to China to Bermuda to Antarctica to Mexico to Massachusetts, unless the ARGO is capable of transportation, there's some _Game of Thrones_-level compression of distances going on. Related to this is that Zhang Ziyi plays twins (Dr. Ilene Chen and Dr. Ling Chen), who we never see together. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin, two fairies that speak for Mothra. Also, Aisha Hinds as Colonel Diane Foster, O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Chief Warrant Officer Jackson Barnes, and Thomas Middleditch as Dr. Sam Coleman may as well not be in the film at all, so little are they given to do. The same could be said for most of the Titans. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film - Baphomet, Typhon, Abaddon, Bunyip, and Methuselah) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.

But for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed _King of the Monsters_. Although the trailer does promise what the film can't deliver, aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. The sound design by Erik Aadahl (_I, Robot_; _The Tree of Life_; _A Quiet Place_) Brandon Jones (_13 Hours_; _The Shallows_), and Tim Walston (_The Incredible Hulk_; _Pacific Rim_; _Chronicle_) is suitably deafening, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher (_The Hangover_; _War Dogs_; _Joker_) has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by the editing by Roger Barton (_Gone in 60 Seconds_; _Pearl Harbor_; _The Grey_), Bob Ducsay (_Season of the Witch_; _Looper_; _Rampage_), and Richard Pearson (_The Bourne Supremacy_; _Quantum of Solace_; _Iron Man 2_), who maintain the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. And even though pretty much the entire film takes place at night in the midst of a storm of the Titans' own making, it never becomes difficult to follow or see what's happening. 

The film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.

_Citizen Kane_ it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine.","**_Very loud, very dumb, and very entertaining_**

And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, ""Arise, devour much flesh."" After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, whic__h had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns._

- Daniel 7:3-7

>_Behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth_ [...] _And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea_ [...] _And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, ""Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?""_ [...] _And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world._

- Revelation 12:3-13:8

I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards's 2014 _Godzilla_. Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper-thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. As Edwards had already proved with his debut film, the superb _Monsters_ (2010) and as he would subsequently prove with _Rogue One: A Star Wars Story_ (2016), he has a knack for wedding large-scale CGI grandiosity to stories that feel contemplative and personalised. And I don't care how long this franchise may run, and how many films get churned out, Godzilla's mic-drop moment, when he holds the female MUTO's mouth open and breathes blue fire down its throat will never be topped in its ""holy shit""-ness. Ironically enough though, what I admired most about the film is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting; it took over an hour before we first saw him, and then he got only seven minutes total screen time. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. Remember when Hulk Hogan was the WWF champion for three years running? He didn't wrestle on every show, he didn't even appear on every show. So when Wrestlemania came around, and we knew the Hulkster would be headlining, it meant more than if we'd just seen him the week prior. Same thing with _Godzilla_. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called _Godzilla_ featured so little, well, Godzilla!

The third film in Legendary Entertainment's ""MonsterVerse"" franchise, _King of the Monsters_ is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he doesn't return as director), and sets up Adam Wingard's _Godzilla vs. Kong_, which has already wrapped shooting, and is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty (_Trick 'r Treat_; _Krampus_) essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre for pretty much the entire runtime (there are four big fight scenes within the first half-hour alone), and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. Indeed, he told Collider, ""_I would call it the_ Aliens _to Gareth's_ Alien."" And although Dougherty isn't half the director that Edwards is, _King of the Monsters_ works pretty well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clichés abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish, and you really can't fault a film for succeeding at its primary objective.

Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world, all in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is the private company Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's _Kong: Skull Island_, which took place in 1973). As the film begins, Monarch employees Dr. Ishirô Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), both returning from the previous film, are attempting to convince the Senate that under no circumstances should control of the Titans be turned over to the military, something with which Admiral William Stenz (the great David Strathairn, also returning from the first film) strongly disagrees. Meanwhile, in China, paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant ""alpha signal"" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed ""Monster Zero"", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.

With production wrapping on _King of the Monsters_ in 2017, and with two release dates scrapped, the film was beginning to accrue some pretty bad buzz. Then that magisterial first trailer dropped, showing Mothra spanning her glorious wings scored with a remix of Claude Debussy's ""Clair de Lune"" from _Suite bergamasque_ (1890) and promising a film of pensive apocalyptic goings-on. It was the sort of trailer to turn even the biggest naysayer around. The good news is that all the best bits from the trailer are in the film. The bad news is that most of the best bits from the film are in the trailer.

Godzilla was originally created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishirô Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya, and first seen on screen in 1954's _Gojira_ (released in North America in 1956 as _Godzilla, King of the Monsters!_, a reedited version of the original with additional scenes and new actors). Over the last six decades, he has appeared in all manner of films and TV shows, from action flicks to eco-metaphors to kid's cartoons to comedy to whatever the hell Roland Emmerich's 1998 version was. Conceived in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the Daigo Fukuryū Maru incident, Godzilla was intended as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. Thematically speaking, the highpoint of the ""Kaiju"" (Japanese for ""strange beast"") genre thus far is probably Hideaki Anno's _Shin Gojira_ (2016), which was a political satire inspired by the Japanese government's response to the 2011 Tôhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.

_King of the Monsters_ has one eye on its themes too (a dire warning of oncoming eco-disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising, exposition-heavy script by Dougherty and Zach Shields, from a story by Max Borenstein, is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. Traditionally, Godzilla is inherently benevolent. However, in the 2014 version, Edwards muddied this concept brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In _King of the Monsters_, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and they wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.

And yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. Jonah, of course, believes that giving the earth back to the Titans is all humanity deserves, and is exactly what the planet needs (it's revealed early in the film that the Titans leave behind biomatter which results in the rapid growth of vegetation). For her part, Emma compares humanity to a virus, and the Titans to a ""fever"" that could eradicate it. Elsewhere, obviously with one eye on the issue of American isolationism under Trump, as well as the unstable geopolitical situation, Serizawa states, ""_sometimes, the only way to heal a wound is to make peace with the demon who caused it_"". The problem with all of this is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clichéd old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.

As we're discussing the script, another problem is repetition. For example, on several occasions, Godzilla is getting his ass handed to him, only to make an 'unexpected' comeback, whilst not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. There are also some hideous clichés. At one point, on their flagship the ARGO, the Monarch people are listening to Godzilla's heartbeat, which is becoming weaker and weaker, and Dr. Rick Stanton (a criminally underused Bradley Whitford) implores, all earnest-like, ""_c'mon big guy_."" It's supposed to be a moment of great pathos, tapping into the audience's empathy for Godzilla. Instead, at the screening I attended, everyone laughed, so clunky and self-serious was the moment. 

Another scene that doesn't work, although in a completely different way, is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera not even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word ""Deceased"" written underneath. Not exactly the best way to handle a major death. There's also a (predictable) twist based on what could charitably be called ill-defined character motivations. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Kyle Chandler, he has precious little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another, oftentimes even narrating their motivations. In any case, not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional, with not a hint of interiority amongst the lot of them. Additionally, because the scale of the fights is so massive, and the humans so poorly written, Dougherty is unable to make the characters seem even remotely significant. This was another area where Edwards did well, marrying the spectacle with smaller human drama, but Dougherty allows the spectacle to overwhelm everything else.

There are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes. From Colorado to China to Bermuda to Antarctica to Mexico to Massachusetts, unless the ARGO is capable of transportation, there's some _Game of Thrones_-level compression of distances going on. Related to this is that Zhang Ziyi plays twins (Dr. Ilene Chen and Dr. Ling Chen), who we never see together. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin, two fairies that speak for Mothra. Also, Aisha Hinds as Colonel Diane Foster, O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Chief Warrant Officer Jackson Barnes, and Thomas Middleditch as Dr. Sam Coleman may as well not be in the film at all, so little are they given to do. The same could be said for most of the Titans. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film - Baphomet, Typhon, Abaddon, Bunyip, and Methuselah) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.

But for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed _King of the Monsters_. Although the trailer does promise what the film can't deliver, aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. The sound design by Erik Aadahl (_I, Robot_; _The Tree of Life_; _A Quiet Place_) Brandon Jones (_13 Hours_; _The Shallows_), and Tim Walston (_The Incredible Hulk_; _Pacific Rim_; _Chronicle_) is suitably deafening, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher (_The Hangover_; _War Dogs_; _Joker_) has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by the editing by Roger Barton (_Gone in 60 Seconds_; _Pearl Harbor_; _The Grey_), Bob Ducsay (_Season of the Witch_; _Looper_; _Rampage_), and Richard Pearson (_The Bourne Supremacy_; _Quantum of Solace_; _Iron Man 2_), who maintain the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. And even though pretty much the entire film takes place at night in the midst of a storm of the Titans' own making, it never becomes difficult to follow or see what's happening. 

The film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.

_Citizen Kane_ it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine."
373571,"When I watched the 2014 Godzilla movie I was less than impressed as can be seen from my review here.

When watching this one I felt it was marginally better.

True to the Hollywood standards today, or perhaps lack thereof, the script writers just had to try and squeeze in a lot of green bullshit about how we destroy the planet and something has to be done bla bla bla.

Interesting enough though, the way it was done, actually made the green fanatics the bad guys in the movie. Whether that was intentional or the writers was too stupid to realize it I do not know.

The story is essentially about how one green fanatic in particular releases the “Titans” as they are called in the movie and uses them to wreak havoc, killing millions, to “balance things” and start a new world. That is your typical green fanatic although with a bit more means than usual to implement his deluded fantasies. Of course Godzilla, with the help of a few clear minded humans, comes to the rescue. That’s pretty much it. As I wrote, a typical substandard Hollywood script.

What makes this movie better though is that the implementation is not so shit full of absolutely stupid and unintelligent sequences as the 2014 movie. The implementation is actually not that bad. The action sequences are really quite good and there’s plenty of big ass monsters in this movie.

I also quite liked that cool super-carrier airplane that the Monarch crew flew around in.

As despicable as the previously mentioned green fanatic is, the role was nicely implemented as well as the main protagonist and most people around him.

The part about kick-starting Godzilla after he was wounded by detonating a nuke in front of his nose was a bit silly though. So was the hole it’s to hot and radioactive for drones as well as for a nuclear submarine so let’s send in a guy on foot. Seriously?

Also the after scenes where life magically sprouted everywhere the Titans had wrecked havoc was more than a little stupid.

If this hadn’t been a cool giant monster movie with a lot of special effects I would have scored it a lot lower. However, I am a sucker for these kinds of movies and I really like Godzilla. I even watched some of the old black and white movies when I was a kid.","When I watched the 2014 Godzilla movie I was less than impressed as can be seen from my review here.

332794,"Lambert Wilson is the innovative underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau in this rather unremarkable depiction of his life and career. He is married to Simone (Audrey Tautou) but has a bit of a wandering eye so they become maritally estranged, even though they continue to live and workout on their converted WWII minesweeper ""Calypso"". Needless to say, this puts some strain on the rest of the family, not least upon his relationship with his publicity magnet, heart-throb, eldest Philippe (Pierre Niney). The latter man's character is used as a barometer a little here to measure the actions of his father. The exploration activities must face stark realities. Money is needed to buy the 1½ tons of fuel the ship needs each trip, and that's before wages and other costs associated with their more scientific endeavours have to be paid. This leads to Cousteau becoming more of a businessman with almost corporate responsibilities. It's those activities that see a split between father and son that lasts until a trip to the Antarctic that sees a well documented tragedy hit the family. For the most part this is a soap opera of a film with nowhere near enough focus on what made the man famous in the first place. There is some underwater photography to liven things up, and a sequence with an expanding group of sharks that's quite menacingly filmed, but there's not really enough of that to compensate for the listless melodrama that's played out. The camera does love Niney and Tautou, and Wilson is competent enough in what is essentially a light-weight and slightly adulatory tale of a man who was clearly much more interesting, flawed and charismatic than we see here.","Lambert Wilson is the innovative underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau in this rather unremarkable depiction of his life and career. He is married to Simone (Audrey Tautou) but has a bit of a wandering eye so they become maritally estranged, even though they continue to live and workout on their converted WWII minesweeper ""Calypso"". Needless to say, this puts some strain on the rest of the family, not least upon his relationship with his publicity magnet, heart-throb, eldest Philippe (Pierre Niney). The latter man's character is used as a barometer a little here to measure the actions of his father. The exploration activities must face stark realities. Money is needed to buy the 1½ tons of fuel the ship needs each trip, and that's before wages and other costs associated with their more scientific endeavours have to be paid. This leads to Cousteau becoming more of a businessman with almost corporate responsibilities. It's those activities that see a split between father and son that lasts until a trip to the Antarctic that sees a well documented tragedy hit the family. For the most part this is a soap opera of a film with nowhere near enough focus on what made the man famous in the first place.

387426,"Bong Joon-ho has brought us yet another masterpiece.  Before viewing Okja, I was a little concerned that it would be just a sappy feel good family film about a kid that developed too much of an attachment to a farm animal.
Now, I'm simply amazed at how Bong manages to always give us such emotionally and politically complicated films.

If you understand his style and knack for subtle commentary, then you will see this as another excellent film in the same vein as The Host.

The obvious commentary is clear but not overwhelming and the subtle bits are in true Bong style.  I think many may misinterpret some of his choices, particularly with Gyllenhaal's character and performance, but if you grasp Bong's social and political stances then you'll appreciate the choices.
For anyone who is unaware, all of Bong's movies contain certain elements.  There are the overt elements that include humor (sometimes within the least humorous of situations), suspense, emotional connection, the folly of man and a lack of responsibility on the part of a government or corporation.  But these elements are supported by subtle inclusions which are dotted throughout his movies like little watermarks and always serve to say the things that should be said without saying them.
Besides these factors, and for those less inclined towards analytical movie watching, there is always a great story and magnificent cinematography.
Okja is no exception.
The only disappointing aspect of this movie is that it just came out, I've already watched it and now I'll have to wait another 2-3 years for another Bong movie to enjoy.
I have seen The Host at least 10 times and I could watch it again right now.  I'm certain to see Okja at least two more times with those with whom I enjoy seeing his movies and I don't think it'll feel like a chore either.
In my opinion, Bong is one of the most consistent filmmakers to have ever made a movie and that streak remains unbroken with Okja.","Bong Joon-ho has brought us yet another masterpiece.

588228,"Amazon Prime’s purchase of The Tomorrow War from Paramount was a bold move as the FX-laden film starring Chris Pratt reportedly cost around $200 million to purchase and follows prior purchases of Paramount films by the streamer.

Pratt stars as an ex-soldier named Dan Forester who has just been turned down for a research job he has been seeking and must remain teaching science to less than enthusiastic students.

While watching a Soccer match with his wife, daughter, and friends, the world is stunned when a group of armed individuals appear in a flash of light and tell the televised audience that they have come from thirty years in the future and are seeking help to save humanity.

It is soon learned that an Alien threat they call the White Spikes suddenly appeared and has humanity on the verge of extinction.  The nations of the world send forces into the future to help fight the war but with a very high casualty rate; a worldwide draft is soon instituted to replenish the numbers.

Dan is eventually drafted and told he has 24 hours to get things in order before he is deployed for seven days at which time he will be returned. Dan contemplates running and seeks out his estranged father (J.K. Simmons); who has a deep disdain for governments and conducts himself in a shady fashion to the point where Dan will not let him anywhere near his daughter.

Dan eventually deploys and finds a nightmare version of the future where cities are in ruin and the deadly and very tough enemy is everywhere.

As the tension mounts; Dan must team up with the leader of the resistance to develop a way to fight the aliens and save humanity before it is too late.

The film features some good FX and action and while there were many times I questioned why a different course of action was not attempted; the film eventually attempts to address many questions later in the film.

While the final act may seem overblown and too convenient; the film works as an enjoyable and action-filled escape as long as you are willing to just go along with the ride and not ask too many questions along the way.

While there are elements of prior Science Fiction and Horror films evident; the cast and premise work well and the movie is a step above most offerings that are sold to streaming services and is well worth a watch.

It's usually a good sign when the worst part of a time travel movie is the time travel.

I could probably make an hour long video on the time travel in this movie, especially compared to ""Looper"", but I'll forego that enough to say that it's well leveraged for the purposes of the movie.

The ""White Spikes"" are amazingly well put together, though I think projectile spikes are an odd biological evolution.

The story is far from perfect, but the cast, the acting, the situation, and especially the action are all executed wonderfully with a high production value to back it up.","Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

The Tomorrow War is a fun fighting alien creatures, time travel, sci-fi action flick that thoroughly entertains despite its flaws. The film's premise lends to some confusion with trying to change timelines, leading to moments of disjointed logic and confusing plot points. But let me be honest, if you don't take the science seriously, you will enjoy the movie. The aliens are super creepy and overwhelming. Transporting soldiers to the future to help try to overcome a failing war for survival provides a fresh take on the alien battle trope. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that took place in the future where the risk and danger were higher than the present-day parts that were more focused on exposition. Because The Tomorrow War was released straight to streaming, I had low expectations that were undeniably exceeded. I will be back to watch this one again.","**Overall : A fun popcorn sci-fi blockbuster with fun characters, scary aliens, and great action that far outweigh its minor faults.**

21864,"Well done monster flick in a small town of the Great Northwest 

An Alaskan hamlet is attacked by some sort of dragon-like creature, recently awoken from its long frozen hibernation. 

Released to TV, ""Wyvern"" (2009) was directed by the great 'B' monster flick director Stephen R. Monroe, who also did ""Sasquatch Mountain,"" ""Ogre"", ""It Waits"" and the remake of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (2010).

I liked how the story is taken seriously without being dead-serious. The characters seem real and three-dimensional. One of the main roles is Claire, played by Erin Karpluk, one of the most winsome girl-next-door types to walk the face of the earth. 

Meanwhile the dragon isn't just causing havoc without rhyme or reason; it has a plan. The CGI is effective enough considering the budget and time period.

The ending is an obvious homage to Spielberg's excellent 1971 TV flick ""Duel.""

So if you enjoy contemporaneous monster-in-the-woods flicks like ""Goblin,"" ""It Waits"" and ""Ogre"" you'll likely appreciate ""Wyvern,"" which is on par with ""Goblin"" but a bit better than the other two.

The movie runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was filmed in Vancouver, BC.

I'd say the action is an (albeit minor, relatively-speaking) improvement on the original, though I do think the characters and cast aren't quite as strong this time out. Overall, comparing the two, they probably level out to be honest, which is actually a good thing when you're talking about a sequel.

Despite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion. With that said, hopefully Powell can get himself out of this typecast of 'overly cocky guy turns out to be sound' as it's getting a bit tiresome, even though I do really rate him as an actor.","<em>'Twisters'</em> is about what I expected, it's one I enjoyed.

718821,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung’s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it’s admittedly rather fun – to a point. With that said, however, there’s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film’s clichéd, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That’s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell’s character is concerned, I’d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, “Twisters” may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less cliché and considerably more originality.","In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be.

718821,"A tragedy forces meteorologist ""Kate"" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, ""Javi"" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters ""Tyler"" (Glen Powell) - he's a ""tornado wrangler"" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.","A tragedy forces meteorologist ""Kate"" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, ""Javi"" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters ""Tyler"" (Glen Powell) - he's a ""tornado wrangler"" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing."

718821,"Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle “Twisters” falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado “outbreak,” setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that’s so stupid, it’s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.

Former storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor’s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.

Amidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There’s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There’s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.

Most of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado “attacks” and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he’s good looking)! I suppose there’s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin’ hunk, but even his charm can’t carry the movie.

The film’s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people’s hats.

The special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms’ fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What’s fun about seeing people’s homes destroyed and lives ruined?

Disaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about “Twisters” than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they’re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It’s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.

MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD

1. Javi is written as an unintentional antagonist and it's kinda dumb. Furthermore, the issue between Javi and Kate is also never really addressed. They both lost their friends and for all intents and purposes it appears Kate built up walls around herself, left town and never looked back. Both of these characters have had to live with and deal with the loss of their friends but in the scene when Javi snaps at Kate, it's hard not to take Javi's side, and we're meant to take Kate's side because the movie follows Kate. Javi is barely in it. The scene that follows between Tyler and Kate felt like it should've been between Javi and Kate, minus the romance because we don't actually need romance in everything.
2. They went a little too far with ""reckless Tyler"" in those first few scenes where diving Javi and Kate off the road is played for laughs. No one ever brings it up and Javi even pulls the same stunt with Tyler and Kate during the final act. These people are all supposed to be sensible adults.
3. Apart from mini-boss Scott, Javi's team of trained specialists have no personality or character development and are given barely any screen time compared to Tyler's ragtag storm-wrangling group. We're meant to see Tyler's group as cool because ""oh whoa, they actually know something!"" while we never get to know the team of people who could probably blow your mind with their combined knowledge.
4. My biggest issue with this movie is the two ""opposing"" groups. Javi claims to be doing this for science so we can better understand tornadoes so we can help people, and Tyler's here to help people by being social media famous, selling merchandise and giving out food. They both have the same goal, or claim to, and their different tech and methods of storm chasing could compliment each other, so why the unnecessary animosity, especially from Tyler's group, who, if we're being honest, aren't really doing that much. Tyler mentions a supercomputer at one point and I have to wonder what exactly have they been using this supercomputer access for all this time? If these two clowns worked together, they could've successfully scanned a tornado before the events of this movie.

ANYWAY... LET'S GET TO THE JUICY PART OF MY ""REVIEW""!

What do you suppose Kate's mom was talking about when she mentioned more and more bad weather? Bigots are comically silly, I swear!

664,"**_Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt chasing tornadoes on the prairie_**

When atmospheric conditions are conducive to tornadoes, a weatherman (Paxton) tracks down his separated wife (Hunt) and inadvertently joins their storm-chasing team in the Midwest because he can’t resist seeing his sensor invention finally put to use. Jami Gertz plays his new love, Cary Elwes a pompous rival and Philip Seymour Hoffman a wild team member.

“Twister” (1996) could be categorized as a disaster flick, but with the distinction that the protagonists are constantly chasing the potential disaster. The entire film takes place in the prairies or forests of the Midwest with ominous skies and intermittent destructive tornadoes. It’s called “Twister” and that’s what you get.

The writers keep things interesting by adding human interest with the, admittedly contrived, love triangle and the rival storm-chasing team that has corporate sponsors (the horror, the horror). I didn’t mind the love story. When two people belong together, they belong together. Perhaps the fiancé will realize this. Speaking of which, I’m glad they didn’t make her (Gertz) out to be an unreasonable biyatch, like in “The Parent Trap.”

At the end of the day, “Twister” gives you what you pay for. It’s not rocket science, but it’s entertaining and full of tornado-oriented thrills, which explains why it was a huge hit at the box office. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes, and was shot in Oklahoma (Guthrie and Ponca City), Iowa (Boone and Ames) and Bolton, Ontario.

664,"<em>'Twister'</em> makes for fun viewing.

There's a good chance that this was one of the (if not <em>the</em>) first films that I ever watched, it was released a mere few months after my birth and I have a faint memory of watching it on video as a young kid, I remember my mum had taped it and it was recorded back-to-back with a random music concert that was also on TV at the time - I can still picture myself seeing it switch from the film to the music.

With that said, if I did indeed watch it at that time and it wasn't just a memory of actually checking out the concert itself or perhaps someone else doing either/or, I don't recall anything about this movie - not one jot. I did know the general gist of the film though (hard not to, rather self-explanatory!) and that Bill Paxton was in it.

The movie itself is entertaining, if naturally not perfect. The special effects have aged, for 1996, rather well, there's a couple of goofy looking moments but again, for its time it's more than adequate. The score is pleasant too. I didn't overly like the lover's quarrel, in fact it kinda annoyed me in parts; Melissa is written weakly, there's kinda no need for Jami Gertz's character to even exist given what (predictably) happens.

Helen Hunt puts in a strong showing, probably the standout of the near two hours. Paxton, of course, runs her close in that regard too. Lois Smith and Philip Seymour Hoffman are the ones who stick out most away from Hunt and Paxton. Cary Elwes features too, albeit quite forgettably.

Eager to see what they do for this year's standalone sequel with Glen Powell & Co. Based on snippets of the trailer I've seen, I reckon it'll be just as good - if not slightly better - as this original. Time will tell.","<em>'Twister'</em> makes for fun viewing.

1509382,"""Kherson: Human Safari"" stands as an extraordinary testament to human endurance in the face of unimaginable brutality. Director Zarina Zabrisky has crafted more than a documentary—she has created a vital historical record that captures the raw truth of civilian life under Russian aggression.

The film's five-part structure chronicles the devastating journey of Kherson's residents: from the shock of invasion, through the suffocating months of occupation, the bittersweet liberation, the catastrophic flooding after the Kakhovka Dam's destruction, and the ongoing nightmare of drone warfare that turns human beings into targets for sport.

What makes this work exceptional is its intimacy. These aren't statistics or headlines—these are neighbors, teachers, doctors, and artists who risk everything simply by speaking their truth on camera. Their voices carry the weight of lived experience: the underground hospitals operating by flashlight, the schools teaching in basements, the artists who continue creating amid ruins. One unforgettable scene shows a woman dancing in her destroyed school—an act of defiance that speaks louder than any protest.

The film's power lies not in sensationalism but in its quiet accumulation of testimony. When someone whispers, ""While the world is asleep, we are dying here,"" the words land with devastating precision. The documented drone attacks—where civilians are stalked, filmed, and murdered for online propaganda—reveal a new dimension of warfare's cruelty.

Yet this is fundamentally a story of resistance. Despite nine months of occupation, despite daily terror, Kherson's people refuse to be erased. They protest, they rebuild, they create art, they keep their Christmas trees up for hope. Their mantra ""Vse bude dobre"" (Everything will be fine) isn't naive optimism—it's steel-willed determination.

Zabrisky's brave filmmaking has already drawn backlash from Russian forces, with increased drone strikes following the film's release. This only underscores its importance as both an artistic achievement and an urgent call to action. Available free since June 27, 2025, this film demands to be seen—not as entertainment, but as essential testimony.

Michael Moore has taken on a number of subjects over the years, and his latest project is to add his name to _Planet of the Humans_, a documentary directed by Jeff Gibbs, one of his long time collaborators. 

Timed to release with Earth Day, I expected this to be a pro-green, ""we are all bad"", ""we are the virus"" type thing, but it was, in fact, not really that at all. It's a pretty comprehensive take down of the green industry and how for all their big talk about saving the planet, a lot of their practices are the same, if not worse for the earth than the methods they want to do away with. 

The film also takes aim at certain environmental organisations that when examined are shown to be not so green after all, and in many cases taken over by capitalistic practices.

Michael Moore has taken on a number of subjects over the years, and his latest project is to add his name to _Planet of the Humans_, a documentary directed by Jeff Gibbs, one of his long time collaborators. 

Timed to release with Earth Day, I expected this to be a pro-green, ""we are all bad"", ""we are the virus"" type thing, but it was, in fact, not really that at all. It's a pretty comprehensive take down of the green industry and how for all their big talk about saving the planet, a lot of their practices are the same, if not worse for the earth than the methods they want to do away with. 

The film also takes aim at certain environmental organisations that when examined are shown to be not so green after all, and in many cases taken over by capitalistic practices. It's a deep dive into the shortcomings of the current green energy sector, the destructive operating practices of the biofuel industry, and how billionaires and multinational corporations have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.
