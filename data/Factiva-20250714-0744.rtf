In the film, Iris Simpkins and Amanda Woods famously swap places, from Los Angeles, CA, to the Cotswolds in the United Kingdom, and have the holiday season of a lifetime. Nearly twenty years later, we are thrilled to be celebrating our connection to the film by partnering with Lucy Small and the team at State and Season to recreate Amanda's iconic stay at the Cotswolds Cottage.\par \par \uc2 A nationwide giveaway - enter for your chance to win The Holiday in July\par \par \uc2 On July 14th, U.S. residents of 25+ will be able to enter for a chance to win a stay at The Holiday Cottage. Designed by State and Season, the cottage is a nearly exact replica of the Cotswolds cottage featured in the film, set in the cozy capital of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Ellijay, Georgia (about 1.5 hours north of Atlanta).

"Nearly twenty years after the film was released, we still have prospective and current members of our platform tell us how 'The Holiday' inspired them to join \uc2 HomeExchange\uc2 . Although we can't promise our members that Jude Law or Jack Black will show up on the doorstep of their exchange for a whirlwind romance, we can promise endless opportunities for affordable accommodation, human connection, and the chance to truly travel like a local."\par \par \uc2 A strategic partnership highlighting more thoughtful travel\par \par \uc2 This giveaway signifies a strategic partnership between \uc2 HomeExchange\uc2  and State and Season, a design firm that aligns with the company's core values.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  and local travel are near and dear to the State and Season team.

"So, who better to partner with than \uc2 HomeExchange\uc2 , the website of choice for Amanda and Iris to trade houses in the classic movie? We're so excited to be able to offer this unique stay - everything about our Holiday Cottage is real, from the low ceilings to how difficult it is to actually have a bath. We're partnering with \uc2 HomeExchange\uc2  so that our visitors can experience staying in this home just like the characters from the beloved movie. There are probably few other better examples of off-the-beaten-path travel than this Cotswolds cottage from a beloved romantic comedy built to be a replica in the North Georgia mountains where the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  is actually quite similar to the UK!"\par \par \uc2 To learn more about the giveaway, which runs from July 14th to July 25th 2025, visit {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.homeexchange.com/p/the-holiday-in-july"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.homeexchange.com/p/the-holiday-in-july}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 About \uc2 HomeExchange\par \par \uc2 HomeExchange\uc2  is the global leader in home exchange vacations, offering authentic, sustainable and affordable vacation opportunities for everyone.

Made by him in the 1920s, the film Amazonas, the longest river in the world will open the festival.\par \par \uc2 Related news: Cinesur Festival in Bonito highlights South American cinema and inclusion. Support for audiovisuals as a stimulus to tourism is debated in Noronha. "We need to go beyond ethnographic indigenous cinema," say filmmakers.\par \par \uc2 21 films were selected, six feature films and 15 national shorts, to compete for the Coxipon\u233\'00\'E9 Trophy. The award was inspired by the Bororo ethnic group, which inhabited the banks of the Coxip\u243\'00\'F3 River and is a symbol of cultural resistance in Mato Grosso. Among the criteria adopted by the event's curators are aesthetic and narrative diversity, the protagonism of historically invisible groups and connections with the theme of decolonial Amazonia.\par \par \uc2 The feature films in the competitive showcase are:\par \par \uc2 Maw\u233\'00\'E9, by Jimmy Christian (AM), a fiction film that tells the story of a young indigenous woman's conflict between the rituals of her village and urban life; Pedra Vermelha, by Cassemiro Vitorino and Ilka Goldschmidt (SC), a documentary that follows communities impacted by megaprojects in the south of the country; Kopenawa: Sonhar a Terra-Floresta, by Marco Altberg and Tain\u225\'00\'E1 de Luccas (RJ), which delves into Yanomami cosmological thinking; O Sil\u234\'00\'EAncio das Ostras, by Marcos Pimentel (MG), a sensory essay on mourning and the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ; Backyard Concert, by Juraci J\u250\'00\'FAnior (RO), which transforms music into an instrument of resistance and belonging; Serra das Almas, by L\u237\'00\'EDrio Ferreira (PE), which revisits the poetry of the backlands in a work of fiction. For the director of Cinemato, Luis Borges, this year's selection is extremely important: "This year's theme isn't really just about filmmakers or films made in the Amazon. It's about bringing films that promote a deconstruction of this Eurocentric view that we have of our country, of the subjects of this country."\par \par \uc2 Among the more than 60 films from 19 Brazilian states that will be screened at the festival are works that engage with \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  issues, such as O Sil\u234\'00\'EAncio das Ostras, from Minas Gerais, about the dam collapse in Brumadinho in 2019.\par \par \uc2 For Luis Borges, film festivals are showcases for films that don't get distribution in theaters, and Cinemato also brings the importance of training professionals to work in the film industry in Mato Grosso\par \par \uc2 "With the workshops that were held at the festival, a workforce began to be prepared to be able to make the films, the new projects, the contemporary projects that began to emerge stimulated by the festival. At the time, Cuiab\u225\'00\'E1's exhibition circuit had only one movie theater," says Luis.\par \par \uc2 For the director, Cinemato plays an important role as a showcase and screen for national cinema, since even with the screen quota and laws that have been created to protect the sector, there is still no enforcement in the region. Through the festival, Brazilian cinema finds its audience in Mato Grosso.\par \par \uc2 Dira Paes Award The closing ceremony, scheduled for July 20, will feature Dira Paes, who returns to the festival where she received her first Best Actress award in 1996 for Corisco & Dad\u225\'00\'E1. The artist will personally present the Dira Paes Award, which honors women with outstanding achievements in audiovisual and socio-environmental causes.\par \par \uc2 "It's an honor for me to be part of a festival that I saw come to life in its first edition. It's a festival that has its own DNA, which correlates with its region, with its content, its demands, its reflections on the power of this biome where it takes place. I feel proud to personally present an award with my name on it."\par \par \uc2 Making her directorial debut with Pas\u225\'00\'E1rgada last year, Dira Paes believes that Brazilian cinema is experiencing a very special moment and a historic year, with the Oscar for Best International Film for Ainda Estou Aqui.\par \par \uc2 "I feel that this undoubtedly warms us up in the market as a whole," she says, who worked on the environmental issue in the feature she directed and sees a connection between the themes addressed by Brazilian and world cinema. "Today, we think about common issues, such as the environmental and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  question and the question of democracy as a whole."\par \par \uc2 Acting in Manas, directed by Marianna Brennand, Dira Paes says it's moving to see a film set in the Amazon bring up a universal subject, sexual exploitation and gender violence\par \par \uc2 "Everyone feels touched. It's a cinematic powerhouse that's worth watching," she says. "It's still showing in a few cities in Brazil and I really hope that the whole of Brazil can see this film, which has, in addition to this strength of talent, an exquisite team and a unique directorial style by Mariana Brennand. I think it's important to take the public to this place where you don't just sit passively in the cinema seat.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250713el7d006jg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw167\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2505\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 LIVING\par {\*\bkmkstart toc3}{\*\bkmkend toc3}\b \uc2 How a city united to save the Fox Theatre 50 years ago: If not for a grassroots uprising, the Peachtree Street landmark might be a parking lot today.\b0\par\par\uc2 Rodney Ho rodney.ho@ajc.com \par \uc2 Staff \par \uc2 1,504 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2025\par \uc2 The Atlanta Journal - Constitution\par \uc2 ATJC\par \uc2 Main\par E1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright (c) 2025 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The early 1970s were a difficult time for Midtown Atlanta as residents were fleeing to the suburbs. The deteriorating Fox Theatre was no longer a go-to place for movies. In 1974, owner Mosque Inc. was in talks to sell the land to \uc2 Southern Bell\uc2 , which planned to tear the building down for an office tower and parking lot.\par \par \uc2 But even in a city known for looking forward more than backward, razing this stellar Moorish architectural gem built in 1929 was a step too far.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNative Atlantans were watching downtown Atlanta being dismantled,\u8221\'20\'1D said Leigh Burns, vice president of community partnerships for the Fox. \u8220\'20\'1CThis became a line in the sand.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A grassroots Save the Fox campaign quickly formed. A public hearing at the Fox conducted at the theater by the Georgia Senate Tourism Committee drew 2,500 concerned citizens. Organist Bob Van Camp played music on the Mighty Mo, the 3,622-pipe M\u246\'00\'F6ller Deluxe theater organ inside the Fox. Dressed in a dapper white suit, caretaker Joe Patten, who lived in an apartment in the Fox for decades until his death in 2016 and was known as \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Phantom of the Fox,\u8221\'20\'1D touted the magic of the building.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Maynard Jackson intervened, preventing a demolition permit from being issued. Patten recruited a group of preservation-minded Atlantans to create the nonprofit group Atlanta Landmarks. In 1975, while the theater closed down for nine months, the organization negotiated a land swap with \uc2 Southern Bell\uc2 , which erected a 47-story skyscraper next door on West Peachtree Street instead. (Now called Tower Square, the building sits empty.)\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a complicated deal I worked on for more than seven months,\u8221\'20\'1D said Joe Myers, a former Atlanta real estate lawyer now retired in Asheville, North Carolina. \u8220\'20\'1CWe had to buy nine plots of land around the Fox and swap them with \uc2 Southern Bell\uc2 . It was a long shot, but we made it work.\u8221\'20\'1D (Myers\u8217\'20\'19 son Jay is now on the board of the Fox Theatre.)\par \par \uc2 To cover the cost, Atlanta Landmarks borrowed $3.8 million from several banks that had to be paid off by 1978. This led to frantic and often creative fundraising efforts once the theater reopened in October 1975.\par \par \uc2 Schoolchildren held bake sales and penny drives. Restaurants hosted special days and gave cuts of their revenues. Thousands of \u8220\'20\'1CSave the Fox\u8221\'20\'1D T-shirts and bumper stickers were sold. Billboards adorned highways. Lynyrd Skynyrd played three benefit concerts at the Fox that became a successful live album.\par \par \uc2 In 1976, Carolyn Mills was given paid time off from Eastern Airlines as a communications director to organize a benefit for the Fox featuring Madame Tussaud\u8217\'20\'19s Wax Museum figures such as Mae West and Humphrey Bogart and a male fashion show with \uc2 Atlanta Falcons\uc2  quarterback Steve Bartkowski and UGA football coach Vince Dooley, among others, walking the runway.\par \par \uc2 Bit by bit, it worked.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe were able to make the Fox grand again,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mills, 88, who recalls seeing Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis live on stage at the Fox as a teenager. She has been there hundreds of times since, most recently for opening night of \u8220\'20\'1CThe Book of Mormon\u8221\'20\'1D in June.\par \par \uc2 The theater\u8217\'20\'19s origins begin with the Shriners, a growing Freemason fraternal organization, that began building the structure as its local headquarters with an ambitious Middle Eastern mosque motif. But costs escalated and movie mogul \uc2 William Fox\uc2  helped save the day, pouring in the remainder of the overall cost of $3 million (or $56 million in 2025 dollars.) The Fox Film studio founder owned a chain of Fox theaters across the country at the time.\par \par \uc2 The Fox opened as a movie palace with great fanfare on Christmas Day 1929, introducing \u8220\'20\'1CSteamboat Willie,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Disney\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s first cartoon with Mickey Mouse. It thrived for decades, hosting not just first-run movies but opera performances and acts like Elvis Presley and Nelson Eddy. Fast forward to the mid-\u8217\'20\'1970s, and Fox\u8217\'20\'19s colorful history helped seal the deal with donors, who poured cash into the campaign to save the theater.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage was paid off four months ahead of time in early 1978, a final $100,000 donation from Gov. George Busbee putting them over the top. To celebrate, the Fox held a free open house and concert with Camp, the organist.\par \par \uc2 Since it reopened, the Fox has been a magnet for live performances and has turned a profit each year. Broadway shows flock there. Local acts such as the B-52s, R.E.M. and Jeff Foxworthy have headlined many times while international icons like the Rolling Stones and Prince (including his final shows in 2016) made multiple visits.\par \par \uc2 The Fox generated its highest annual revenue to date when it brought in $41.4 million against $29.4 million in expenses for the fiscal year that ended June 20, 2024, according to its 2024 financial statement provided to the federal government.\par \par \uc2 But keeping the Fox in tiptop shape has never been a cheap endeavor. For years, a portion of ticket sales was set aside for a \u8220\'20\'1CSave the Fox\u8221\'20\'1D fund.\par \par \uc2 Millions have been spent to renovate and maintain the intricate space including the gilded minarets on the roof, the grand arcade and the ornate starry night ceiling inside the auditorium.\par \par \uc2 Today, the upkeep of the building is incorporated in a facilities and preservation fund, costing the Fox $1.5 million to $2.8 million a year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEvery time it rains, we have to check the roof for leaks,\u8221\'20\'1D Burns said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have a restoration manager and \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  team. They regularly check the plaster. You need specialists who know how to do the paint correctly and restore and replace original glass.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Given the fragility of the items in the building, the temperature and humidity is monitored 24/7.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, the Fox remains busy. It\u8217\'20\'19s one of the top grossing theaters of its size in the country, holding more than 300 events a year, from proms and weddings to Broadway musicals, rock concerts and comedy shows.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s an expectation from the Atlanta community that we be successful,\u8221\'20\'1D said Burns, an Atlanta native who has worked at the Fox since 2017. \u8220\'20\'1CFailure has never been an option. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 With a seating capacity of 4,665, The Fox now has more rivals than ever. The Roxy at the Battery (capacity: 3,600) opened in 2017. The Eastern in Reynoldstown (2,200) opened in 2021. \uc2 Live Nation\uc2  is planning a 5,300-seat entertainment venue in downtown Atlanta, slated to open in 2027.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe welcome the competition,\u8221\'20\'1D said Jamie Vosmeier, vice president of sales and marketing. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are venues close to our size, but nobody can match the experience.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Fox isn\u8217\'20\'19t resting on its laurels. It invested millions to build out the 10,000-square-foot Marquee Club in 2018, taking over space once housed by jazz club Churchill Grounds to create a special VIP experience for patrons to eat and drink before and after events. It spent $500,000 revamping the Mighty Mo organ in 2020.\par \par \uc2 And it has continued to expand Fox Gives, a fund it created in 2008 that distributes grants to other historic theaters in the state with a \u8220\'20\'1Cpay it forward\u8221\'20\'1D-style ethos. Over 17 years, it has contributed $4.2 million to 70 theaters including the Plaza Theatre in Poncey-Highland and 7 Stages in Little Five Points.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, the Fox introduced an annual Archives Day in its Egyptian Ballroom and neighboring Grand Salon. This year\u8217\'20\'19s event is scheduled for Sunday Aug. 10, enabling entrants to hear from experts about how the Fox maintains the building and see artifacts up close. The event now draws about 250 curiosity seekers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey have a fabulous collection,\u8221\'20\'1D said Paul Crater, vice president of collections and research services for the Atlanta History Center, which collaborates with the Fox on the event. \u8220\'20\'1CEverything is kept in a security \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 -controlled area.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc4}{\*\bkmkend toc4}\b \uc2 Irvine Welsh takes aim at 'brain atrophying' tech ahead of new Trainspotting sequel\b0\par\par\uc2 Helen ROWE \par \uc2 510 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 July 2025\par 07:45 AM\par \uc2 Agence France Presse\par \uc2 AFPR\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright Agence France-Presse, 2025 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved. \par \par \uc2 Scottish author Irvine Welsh on Friday described the new sequel to his cult novel "Trainspotting" as an antidote to a world full of "hate and poison", as he took aim at social media, the internet and AI.\par \par \uc2 "Men in Love", the latest in a series of sequels, follows the same characters -- Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie -- as they experience the heyday of rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Welsh's novel was turned into the wildly successful 1996 hit film of the same name directed by Danny Boyle and starring Ewan McGregor.\par \par \uc2 The black comedy drama featured a group of heroin addicts living in an economically-depressed part of Edinburgh.\par \par \uc2 "We're living in a world that seems to be so full of hate and poison. Now it's time I kind of focus more on love as a kind of antidote to all that," Welsh said.\par \par \uc2 Although his novel was published over 30 years ago, there were many parallels with the world today, he added.\par \par \uc2 The 1980s demise of much heavy industry such as shipbuilding in the Leith area of Edinburgh heralded a new world for some "without paid work".\par \par \uc2 "Now we're all in that position. We don't know how long we'll have paid work, if we do have it, because our economy, our society, is in just a long form revolutionary transformation," he told \uc2 BBC\uc2  radio.\par \par \uc2 "It's a big, contentious, messy revolution. There's lots to play for, but there's some very dystopian tendencies within it," he added.\par \par \uc2 Despite the problems faced by earlier generations, Welsh said he detected less optimism now.\par \par \uc2 "I think we're just a bit more scared... I think we've got this existential threat on the horizon, basically, of species extinction... through kind of wars and diseases and famines and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and no economic means for younger people to make their way in the world as we had," he said.\par \par \uc2 Welsh also took aim at artificial intelligence (AI), an internet appropriated by big corporations and a social media culture marred by "vitriolic pile-ons".\par \par \uc2 He said the internet had stopped people from thinking and had created a "controlling \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 " in which "we just take instruction".\par \par \uc2 "We've got artificial intelligence on one side, and we've got a kind of natural stupidity on another side. We just become these dumbed down machines that are taking instruction.\par \par \uc2 "And when you get machines thinking for you, your brain just atrophies."\par \par \uc2 He said he hoped that people's current addiction to mobile phones would be a phase that runs its course.\par \par \uc2 "You look down the street and you see people with a phone stuck to their face.\par \par \uc2 "Hopefully, if we survive the next 50 years, that's going to look as strange on film as... people chain smoking cigarettes did back in the 80s," he added.\par \par \uc2 "Men in Love" is due to be published by Penguin on July 24.\par \par \uc2 har/ach\par \par \uc2 Document AFPR000020250711el7b009st\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw135\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2025\pichgoal600

Open Media Network Pvt. Ltd. \par \par \uc2 Being a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, check. Presenting the FIFA World Cup football trophy, check. Presenting at the Oscars, check. Got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, check, check.\par \par \uc2 For someone who has done only one Hollywood movie, a noisy popcorn blockbuster, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, in 2017, Deepika Padukone has had tremendous success at becoming the global face of Indian beauty. Much of it is because though her recent film work has been selective, her roles as an advocate for mental health and as the Indian face of global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, have put her right on the international map. She is not as iconic to Cannes as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, nor is she as mononymously famous in the US as her contemporary Priyanka Chopra Jonas, but Deepika Padukone has always known how to maximise her celebritydom.\par \par \uc2 So whether it is the ability to ride the storm of controversy around Padmaavat by becoming the poster girl of feminism or to become a proponent of eight-hour working days for new mothers when she went head-to-head with one of India's most successful filmmakers, Padukone has shown immense marketing skills. Then there is the choice of films she has done in India, mostly action spectacles opposite top heroes such as Shah Rukh Khan (Jawan and Pathaan), Hrithik Roshan (Fighter) and Prabhas (Kalki 2898 AD). These last four films alone, in the last two years, have grossed `3,599 crore, solidifying her status as the go-to star for action in India. If her application for a star on the walk of fame has been accepted, it's only fair. (By Kaveree Bamzai)\par \par \uc2 Sanjay Gaikwad: Canteen Ruckus\par \par \uc2 Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad was in the news for all the wrong reasons when he beat an employee at the MLA hostel canteen in Mumbai. Gaikwad was understood to have been incensed over the poor quality of food and later acknowledged his actions were harsh but claimed to have shaken the authorities out of their slumber. Maharashtra Chief Minister \uc2 Devendra Fadnavis\uc2  disapproved of the incident but this is not the first time Sena MLAs or MPs have got agitated over food at canteens. In 2014, soon after the Lok Sabha election, a controversy erupted when Sena MPs sought to force feed a staffer at Delhi's Maharashtra Sadan for poor fare.\par \par \uc2 Ideas\par \par \uc2 Originality\par \par \uc2 If you have been to a theatre lately, you'd be forgiven for thinking you had time-travelled at least a few decades. Superman, the latest James Gunn-Warner Bros attempt at rebooting the story of the original caped crusader, arrives this weekend to theatres already teeming with remakes, sequels and reboots. There is Jurassic World: Rebirth, the latest iteration of a franchise that stretches back to 1993's Jurassic Park; 28 Years Later, where Danny Boyle has reanimated the corpses of his 2002 zombie flick 28 Days Later; and there's still Final Destination: Bloodlines, the latest in an unending horror franchise still hanging around in multiplexes. And there are many more arriving soon, from a remake of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer, a new The Naked Gun; a remake of 1989's The War of the Roses called The Roses; to a sequel to the 2003 comedy Freaky Friday; and not to forget a new Fantastic Four movie.\par \par \uc2 Hollywood has a long history of remaking films, but this latest spell teeming with so many remakes and sequels shows an industry in a creative free fall. Remakes of course can be creative, but that is not what most of these films aspire to be. Gareth Edwards, the director of Jurassic World: Rebirth, told the BBC, "The goal was that it should feel like Universal Studios went into their vaults and found a reel of a film, brushed the dust off and it said: Jurassic World: Rebirth"\par \par \uc2 The pandemic proved to be a big blow globally for film industries, with audience choosing to watch movies on streaming platforms. As more films fail, studio heads, who probably came of age in the 1990s, are signing off on films that seek to recreate the feeling of an era they grew up in.\par \par \uc2 Money Mantra\par \par \uc2 Earnings Season Is Key\par \par \uc2 It gives an insight into whether the business is meeting real economic demand\par \par \uc2 THE EARNINGS SEASON, which has just started, will determine the long-term trend of stock market and prices of individual companies.\par \par \uc2 Here's why it matters more than almost anything else.\par \par \uc2 First, earnings season delivers a reality check. Stock prices often incorporate expectations about revenue growth, profit margins and future outlook. When companies report, they either confirm those expectations or shatter them-sometimes wildly. By tracking earnings releases, you gain insight into which businesses are meeting real economic demand and which ones may be running out of momentum.\par \par \uc2 Second, earnings season offers forward guidance-and therein lies its true power. Many companies frame their performance not just by reporting past results, but by forecasting upcoming quarters. If management raises guidance, implying stronger sales or cost efficiencies ahead, investors tend to bid the stock higher. Conversely, lowered guidance often triggers sell-offs, even if the current quarter's numbers look decent.\par \par \uc2 Third, you get a deep dive into profit margins and expense drivers. Top-line revenue growth is important, but the story often lives in the details: gross, operating and net margins. Did margins expand because of pricing power, leaner operations or a more favourable product mix? Or did inflationary costs force the company to sacrifice margins just to keep sales volume steady?\par \par \uc2 Fourth, earnings season shines a light on cash flow and balance-sheet strength. Earnings per share can be influenced by non-cash items-depreciation, amortisation or one-off charges-whereas free cash flow tells you how much real cash a business generates. Positive cash flow is the lifeblood of dividend payments, share buybacks and debt reduction.\par \par \uc2 In sum, earnings season is a recurring litmus test for corporate health and market expectations. By focusing on earnings surprises, forward guidance, margin dynamics, cash-flow strength, management commentary and broader sector trends, you position yourself to react swiftly and intelligently.

This is an area in Jharkhand known to have many elephants moving about. The elephant had gone into labour, and the people recording this moment were staffers aboard a goods train, who upon realising what was going on, had halted the train and waited for over two hours for the animal to safely deliver its calf and move away. Our social media feeds often abound with reports of human-animal conflict, often involving elephants. But here was a rare moment of understanding and compassion.

It focuses on incorporating research of transnational fandoms in people\u8217\'20\'19s own English language scholarship. Historically, border-crossing fandoms have been conceptualized primarily through a transnational lens. Today, research of transcultural fandoms increasingly proliferates in the pages of academic journals and anthologies, as well as in conferences globally. Among online acquaintances is a woman who has seen the January 2016 special episode of Sherlock, \u8220\'20\'1CThe Abominable Bride,\u8221\'20\'1D some six times in the theater, and Benedict Cumberbatch\u8217\'20\'19s Hamlet both live in London and upwards of 11 times in movie theaters over a seven-month period.

Although their activities were circumscribed by the government until the end of World War II and were subject to censorship during the postwar Allied occupation, they now operate in an atmosphere of considerable freedom. The postwar \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  of democracy and economic growth facilitated a rapid expansion of the mass media. In addition, commercial advertising became an immense industry, and Japan emerged as the second largest market, after the United States. Television and newspapers long were the most important advertising media, with magazine and radio advertising being less significant; however, Internet advertising and marketing have made significant inroads.\par \par \uc2 Books and magazines\par \par \uc2 Japan is home to one of the oldest existing printed works in the world, the Hyuakumant\u333\'01\'4Ddarani (\u8220\'20\'1CMantras of the Million Pagodas\u8221\'20\'1D), produced in 770 ce. Printing with moveable type was introduced into Japan from Europe and from the Korean peninsula at the end of the 16th century. Books began to reach a wider audience in the latter half of the 18th century, during the Edo period, but a mass market did not emerge until a century later, when new printing techniques became available at the beginning of the \uc2 Meiji\uc2  period.\par \par \uc2 A great many magazines were launched during the \uc2 Meiji\uc2 , a number of which became the cornerstones for some of Japan\u8217\'20\'19s large present-day publishing houses. Notable among these is the K\u333\'01\'4Ddansha publishing house. Several thousand magazines are published annually, with the majority of these being monthlies. The genre of Japanese comic books, manga, is immensely popular in the country and has influenced a worldwide audience.\par \par \uc2 The Japanese are voracious readers, with one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s highest per capita consumption rates for books and periodicals. Japan ranks as one of the major book-publishing countries in the world, and Tokyo is the center of the Japanese publishing industry. Tens of thousands of book titles are published annually, covering a very wide variety of fields. Literature accounts for roughly one-sixth of all titles, and interest in new books is fanned by the many literary prizes offered. The most prestigious awards are the Akutagawa Prize and the Naoki Prize.\par \par \uc2 The press\par \par \uc2 Japan\u8217\'20\'19s first modern newspapers also appeared early in the \uc2 Meiji\uc2  period, beginning with the Yokohama mainichishimbun (1871) and followed by the Yomiuri shimbun (1774) and the Asahi shimbun (1879). Also established at that time was Nihon keizaishimbun (1876), Japan\u8217\'20\'19s foremost business daily.\par \par \uc2 The role of newspapers has continued to be of great importance. Japan\u8217\'20\'19s largest dailies rank among the highest in the world in circulation, and all the large papers are generally considered to maintain high editorial standards. Major newspapers print both morning and evening daily editions, and daily circulation is high; the largest papers each have daily press runs of several million. A number of newspapers have nationwide circulation, and some local papers also have large circulations. Ky\u333\'01\'4Dd\u333\'01\'4DTs\u363\'01\'6Bshinsha and Jiji Press are Japan\u8217\'20\'19s largest news agencies.\par \par \uc2 Radio and television\par \par \uc2 Regular radio broadcasting in Japan began in 1926 with the establishment of the nonprofit Nippon H\u333\'01\'4Ds\u333\'01\'4DKy\u333\'01\'4Dkai (NHK; \uc2 Japan Broadcasting Corporation\uc2 ), which until the end of World War II was completely under government control and had a monopoly on the airwaves. Changes to broadcasting laws in 1950 prohibited the government from direct interference with programming\u8212\'20\'14though its board of governors is still appointed by the prime minister and its budget approved by the Diet\u8212\'20\'14and permitted the establishment of private commercial broadcasting stations. \uc2 NHK\uc2  is now a public corporation financed by license fees that are paid by television-set owners. It broadcasts quality, commercial-free programming on both radio and television. The first commercial radio stations began broadcasting in 1951.\par \par \uc2 Regular television broadcasts by NHK began in 1953 and by commercial stations in 1955. \uc2 NHK\uc2  began broadcasting overseas radio programs in 1953; it now produces radio broadcasts in dozens of languages and provides satellite television broadcasting that reaches most of the world. Private commercial broadcasting has gained widespread popularity in Japan. The wide variety of private radio and television networks, many of them owned by newspaper companies, augments the NHK channels. In addition, satellite and cable television reception is common, as is digital broadcasting. Japan has been a pioneer in the development of high-definition television (HDTV).\par \par \uc2 Source: Britannica\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/Media-and-publishing"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/Media-and-publishing}}}\par \par \uc2 Media - Japan\par \par \uc2 * In Japan, revenue in the Media market is projected to reach US$119.99bn in 2025.\par \par \uc2 * The largest market within this market in Japan is Games, which is expected to have a market volume of US$50.94bn in 2025.\par \par \uc2 * In a global comparison, the United States will generate the highest revenue, amounting to US$569.73bn in 2025.\par \par \uc2 * Furthermore, in the Media market in Japan, it is anticipated that 224.38% of total revenues will be generated through digital Media market by 2029.\par \par \uc2 * In Japan, the media landscape is increasingly dominated by digital platforms, reflecting a significant shift in consumer consumption patterns and content delivery.\par \par \uc2 Source: Statista\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/media/japan"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/media/japan}}}\par \par \uc2 Japan Cable and Telecommunications Association\par \par \uc2 Japan Cable and Telecommunications Association was established in September 1980 by cable television companies as its main constituent members.\par \par \uc2 PURPOSE\par \par \uc2 The purpose of Japan Cable and Telecommunications Association is to promote Cable Television ethics through mutual enlightenment and cooperation among Cable Television enterprises, as well as to cope with the problems common to Cable Television enterprises, promote sound development and popularization of Cable Television, and contribute to the promotion of public welfare.\par \par \uc2 BUSINESS\par \par \uc2 * Japan Cable and Telecommunications Association:\par \par \uc2 * Fosters mutual communication among members and settlement of common problems;\par \par \uc2 * Provides research study of the management and the development of Cable Television\par \par \uc2 * broadcasting and telecommunication business;\par \par \uc2 * Fosters communication and negotiation with relevant organizations about Cable Television broadcasting business;\par \par \uc2 * Promotes Cable Television broadcasting and telecommunication business;\par \par \uc2 * Provides education and training for those engaged in Cable Television business;

I mean, look at that. You know, that's a pretty good day for the Dow, considering how close it is to its record high. The NASDAQ holding on as well as the S&P shrugging off a lot of these tariff worries. Those are the markets, and these are the main events.\par \par \uc2 Brazil's President threatens to retaliate if the U.S. implements 50 percent tariffs.\par \par \uc2 The number of international visitors to the United States falls in June.\par \par \uc2 And Jane Birkin's original \uc2 Hermes\uc2  bag sells for -- wait for it -- $10 million at auction.\par \par \uc2 Live from New York. It is Thursday, July 10th. I am Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.\par \par \uc2 And good evening, everyone.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, Brazil's President vows to respond after President Trump threatens a 50 percent tariff. \uc2 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\uc2  convened an urgent meeting of his Cabinet earlier. He previously said Brazil would retaliate. The 50 percent tariff is the highest rate President Trump has proposed on any country this week, and would kick in next month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has cited what he calls a witch hunt against Brazil's former President, \uc2 Jair Bolsonaro\uc2 , who has bragged about his ties to the U.S. President. Now, Bolsonaro is facing trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against President Lula. Our Isa Soares explains.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: President Trump is using the economy as a political weapon. He has been saying that tariffs are about leveling the playing field, that there is a trade imbalance and that the United States is being ripped off by other countries. In the case of Brazil, that is not true.\par \par \uc2 President Trump yet is imposing a 50 percent tariff on the country. The reason you ask? A court case against former President \uc2 Jair Bolsonaro\uc2 , a case which he says is a witch hunt in this letter and should end immediately.\par \par \uc2 So this is not about business, but about his buddy. The two have been friends since Trump's first term.\par \par \uc2 DONALD TRUMP\uc2  (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Probably because of the relationship that we have, Brazil and the United States have never been closer.\par \par \uc2 (JAIR BOLSONARO speaking in foreign language.)\par \par \uc2 SOARES (voice over): And they've been building on that relationship ever since.\par \par \uc2 In 2022, Trump supported Bolsonaro's bid for reelection.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : So I strongly endorse President Bolsonaro. He will be your leader for hopefully a long time.\par \par \uc2 SOARES (voice over): And even though he lost to current President \uc2 Lula da Silva\uc2 , Bolsonaro came out for Trump ahead of the 2024 election in the U.S., praising their exceptional relationship when he appeared at a CPAC Convention.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : President Bolsonaro, a great honor.\par \par \uc2 SOARES (voice over): Now back at the White House, Trump, using the weight of the office to help his buddy out. But why is Bolsonaro on trial?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're getting into the Capitol tonight.\par \par \uc2 SOARES (voice over): Well, remember when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol? Brazil had its own version on January the 8th, 2023. Pro-Bolsonaro protesters broke into Congress and the Presidential Palace.\par \par \uc2 I was there in the aftermath, and I personally saw the damage the rioters had done ransacking government buildings, destroying artifacts, including art pieces, even setting some buildings on fire.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say they found a connection between the riots and Brazil's former president, and earlier this year. They charged Bolsonaro, along with 33 other people, in connection with an alleged plot to overthrow the government. Those accused deny the charges.\par \par \uc2 For his part, the Brazilian leader says his country has a right to reciprocate the tariffs and has refused to get involved in Bolsonaro's court case, telling Trump to do the same.\par \par \uc2 LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This country has laws, this country has rules and this country has an owner and that's the Brazilian people. So save your judgments for your own life and keep them out of ours.\par \par \uc2 SOARES (voice over): Isa Soares, CNN, London.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: So for some context here, a 50 percent tariff on Brazil could raise prices on everyday goods. The U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, that is, Brazil buys more from the U.S. than it sells and major imports into the U.S. from Brazil include items like coffee and orange juice, prices in both commodities jumped Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Key Brazilian industries could also face headwinds. Shares in airplane manufacturer Embraer fell on the news.\par \par \uc2 Uria Fancelli is a political analyst for CNN Portugal, and he joins me now from Sao Paulo.\par \par \uc2 Good to see you.\par \par \uc2 [16:05:08]\par \par \uc2 You know, to use a technical term, this is a political bun fight, not an economic one, apparently. I am really curious to learn from you how Brazilians are seeing this? Do the majority feel that President Trump is interfering in their politics?\par \par \uc2 URIA FANCELLI, POLITICAL ANALYST, CNN PORTUGAL: Good evening, Paula. It is nice to be here.\par \par \uc2 Well, Bolsonaro and his supporters are trying to blame the tariffs on Lula, saying it is all because of his lack of pragmatism or this supposed -- or Lula's supposed anti-Western stance, and at the same time, Lula's supporters, the left wing, they're blaming it all on Bolsonaro and they are embracing a kind of discourse that is more expected from right wingers, so more nationalistic.\par \par \uc2 So we are seeing Brazilians really divided. It is a highly polarized country. We will have presidential elections next year in October, and Bolsonaro, he can't run for office because he has been considered unable to run by the Brazilian Supreme Court, but he will probably have someone to appoint to run against current President Lula.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: So I hear what you're saying that the country is polarized and that's pretty much they see whatever is happening right now with the tariffs through that lens, right, through the aperture of politics. Economically, though, which country do you believe would be the biggest loser here? I mean, we just pointed out that, in fact, Brazil buys more from the United States than it sells.\par \par \uc2 FANCELLI: I think Brazil is actually a very easy target, because the argument used by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  about so-called trade injustices committed by Brazil is completely detached from reality.\par \par \uc2 In 2024, Brazil actually ran a trade deficit with the United States of over $280 million and if we include services, the U.S. has had a surplus of more than $250 billion with Brazil over the past decade. So among the world's major economies, Brazil is one of the few where the trade balance clearly favors the United States. So it is an argument that simply -- it doesn't make any sense. And what does it signal to the rest of the world? I think two things.\par \par \uc2 First, that trade on large scale is now being openly used as a tool of pressure over a country's internal decisions, including judicial ones, so everyone should be aware of that, meaning no one is safe. And second, that if the target is the \uc2 BRICS\uc2 , it is worth noticing that both Brazil and India have tried to maintain an image that is not anti-Western, unlike what China and Russia might be pushing.\par \par \uc2 They want to position the \uc2 BRICS\uc2  as an alternative bloc, not an oppositional one. But when Trump acts this way, it is only reinforcing the Global South narrative, one that sees the U.S. as an unpredictable and increasingly aggressive, but Brazil is definitely the weaker side, the Brazilian exports to the U.S. only represent less than one percent of total U.S. imports.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: And I hear you on that, especially when it comes to the \uc2 BRICS\uc2  and how they have stood. It is not supposed to be against the United States, but that is the way \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  interprets it.\par \par \uc2 How much do you believe a tariff war, a trade war like this will influence Lula's government to further strengthen its relationship with China?\par \par \uc2 FANCELLI: I think it definitely brings Brazil and China closer. Lula will have to find a very smart way to respond. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  made it very clear during his letter to -- on his letter to the Brazilian government, saying that if Brazil decided to impose -- to hit Brazil -- the U.S. with more tariffs, then Trump would escalate even further.\par \par \uc2 So President Lula is now considering using an existing tool, the so-called Law of Economic Reciprocity as a way to respond. But for now, the Brazilian government is holding off. They're waiting to see if this 50 percent tariffs will actually go into effect. So until August 1st, Paula, it is all about watching and preparing. The big challenge for Brazil is this: How do you respond in a way that shows strength, but without shooting yourself in the foot. No one wants to end up in a spiral of tit-for-tat tariffs that end up doing more harm than good, especially when you know you're the smaller player in this equation.\par \par \uc2 Retaliation definitely is on the table, but if it happens, it will have to come in a very smart and strategic ways. For example, with Brazil, Brazil is already talking about suspending patents of U.S. pharmaceuticals, which would open the door for local companies to produce generic versions of expensive American medications.\par \par \uc2 [16:10:14]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Right. It is an option. But I hear you, it would be quite an escalation.\par \par \uc2 Uria Fancelli, thank you so much. Really appreciate your analysis there.\par \par \uc2 Now, the president's proposal for 50 percent tariffs on Brazil is the latest instance of him using tariffs as an economic weapon, but for a political purpose.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, he threatened an extra 10 percent tariff -- I remember I was just talking about this -- on any country aligning itself with what he called anti-American policies of the \uc2 BRICS\uc2  nations. Now, it wasn't his first threat against the bloc. In November, he threatened a hundred percent tariffs unless they commit to not creating a shared currency.\par \par \uc2 And in February he imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, ostensibly over fentanyl trafficking.\par \par \uc2 Alayna Treene is at the White House who has been consistently on the tariff beat.\par \par \uc2 The tariffs on Brazil, they won't be imposed until August 1st. So you just heard some of our analysis there, but it doesn't seem to me that there is any common ground here. It is not like the other countries where there is an open negotiation and he might be using this, President Trump, as some kind of negotiation tactic.\par \par \uc2 ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, I mean, there are a few huge differences with these tariffs to Brazil, particularly when you look at the flurry of letters that President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has sent to different countries in recent days.\par \par \uc2 One is that the 50 percent tariff that he is proposing to impose on August 1st is far higher than the tariffs that he has argued he was planning to put on other countries. But then, of course, it is also the political nature of these tariffs.\par \par \uc2 The President wrote this specifically. He said that the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a highly respected leader throughout the world during his term, including by the United States is an international disgrace. And you're right, this quickly escalating dispute because we've now seen, of course, Brazilian President Lula argued that they are going to respond, his country, in turn, with reciprocal tariffs of their own if the President moves forward with these.\par \par \uc2 You know, it is unclear how they're going to get out of this because the President has seemed to make, you know, ending this prosecution of Bolsonaro as the key to ultimately lifting these potential tariffs and that's the big issue, I think, here. And that's why I think these tariffs, specifically this letter that he had sent to Brazil, is getting so much attention because of the nature of the political, you know, wanting to intervene in political politics on behalf of an ally of the President.\par \par \uc2 And one thing as well, I think, is important to note here, important context, Paula, is that we actually did see Bolsonaro do an interview with "The Wall Street Journal" a few months ago, and he argued that he was going to be, you know, or he, hoped I should say that this White House would put economic pressure on the government of Brazil, the New President, Lula's government, to try and get him out of this, you know, some of these legal challenges that he is facing.\par \par \uc2 And so all of that, I think, is why there is so much attention on this and also a lot of questions of one, how can this de-escalate? But also is the President actually going to move ahead with this? And if he does, is there going to be a way out of this?\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Yes, you make a good point. You wonder if the Trump administration is running, you know, the script of Bolsonaro and his allies, given what he said quite bluntly to "The Wall Street Journal."\par \par \uc2 Before you go, I want to ask you about Congress' role in all of this and it is not just about the threats of tariffs on Brazil, but other proposed tariffs. Congress is supposed to have the last word here. These tariffs aren't necessarily a national security interest and that's really the only reason that the President on his own, is supposed to be able to impose these tariffs.\par \par \uc2 TREENE: That's exactly right. You know, the authority does lie with Congress to impose tariffs unless it is for National Security purpose and we've really seen the President essentially ever since he began some of these trade wars and wanting to impose these tariffs on multiple countries, this has been a key question and a key issue that has continuously come up that we've really seen this administration try to push the bounds of power -- of executive power on.\par \par \uc2 Look, what we have now heard repeatedly from officials here at the White House and the broader Trump administration is that they believe it is the President's prerogative. They believe he won a mandate in the election, that this is something that he gets to decide. They do still, you've seen this in some of the policy papers on a lot of these tariffs that they do cite National Security concerns for the reasoning and the justification for him moving forward with this, but there is no question, Paula, that we've seen a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill argue that this is beyond his authority and that, you know, wanting to look at this. But so far, we haven't really seen any significant challenges to kind of prove that he is going to back away from this at this point.\par \par \uc2 But again, going back to my point about Brazil specifically, you're right, this is in relation to all of these tariffs. But I think that's why, again, Brazil is so different here because if it really is a political nature for some of you know, him saying that he needs to end, that Brazil needs to end the prosecution of Bolsonaro as the reasoning mostly for those tariffs, that is where perhaps Congress might have, you know, more justification to try and fight some of these.\par \par \uc2 [16:15:11]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Right. I hear you, that it might actually be a test case for how much further he can go with these tariffs, and if he can go through with them at all.\par \par \uc2 Alayna Treene for us, grateful to you.\par \par \uc2 Now, as Russia hits Ukraine with record-breaking airstrikes, Western leaders are trying to force President Putin to the negotiating table. We will discuss a day of diplomacy after the break.\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: U.S. continuing jobless claims have risen to nearly two million. That is the highest level since November 2021. Now, President Trump's domestic policy law is set to make cuts to benefits that people use during hard times. That includes programs like food stamps and Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 In fact, CNN's Jeff Zeleny spoke to a woman in Missouri who relies on Medicaid for her daughter with cerebral palsy.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not a luxury. This is not a luxury. I do not have my daughter enrolled on Medicaid so that we can have fancy things. I have my daughter enrolled in Medicaid so that we can keep her alive.\par \par \uc2 I am worried that the red tape is going to affect our Medicaid because of just the oversight burdens. And that as a result. I am going to lose my daughter.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Now, this might come as a surprise to some. The U.S. actually spends a lot of money on social programs. Nearly 30 percent of its GDP as of 2019, now, you'll note that's before the pandemic, led to big spending fluctuations almost everywhere in the world. The U.K. isn't far behind, spending more than 24 percent of its GDP on social programs that year.\par \par \uc2 Now, Prime Minister \uc2 Keir Starmer\uc2  had to recently walk back a plan to cut disability benefits after facing a rebellion from Labour lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Danny Sriskandarajah is the CEO of the \uc2 New Economics Foundation\uc2 . He is also the former CEO of \uc2 Oxfam\uc2 , and he joins us now.\par \par \uc2 Happy to have you with us.\par \par \uc2 Now, look, the economists have declared that Britain's social contract is fraying. They didn't say it was failing, though. Starmer's Labour Party has been in government for a year now. Voters, though already grumbling, is the fragility of that social safety net something that Labour is always expected to uphold? Is that really at the heart of the voters' contempt right now?\par \par \uc2 DANNY SRISKANDARAJAH, CEO, \uc2 NEW ECONOMICS FOUNDATION\uc2 : Absolutely. I think there is a lot of disappointment amongst an electorate that gave this government a huge majority about a year ago, but since then, the Labour government has really struggled to make inroads into a cost of living crisis that's been with us for quite a few years.\par \par \uc2 [16:20:11]\par \par \uc2 Britain had high inflation for several years and wages, especially for the lower end of the labor market, just weren't keeping up. And I think there was a lot of hope that this progressive Labour government would do more to protect those at sort of the lower end of the economy and that just hasn't been happening, and of course, for a whole bunch of other reasons to do with fiscal responsibility and the so-called fiscal rules, the government has actually gone ahead and tried to cut benefits for the poorest people in the country, including those living with disabilities.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: And in terms of that pressure on the social safety net, I mean, it is a phenomenon that will strike nearly every developed country. Starmer, in fact, has spoken quite bluntly that if Britain is to defend itself from an existential threat and still grow the economy, there will be sacrifices.\par \par \uc2 Now you argue what is needed is a tax system for the 21st Century. What does that look like? Because many people do not believe that that's possible right now if you want to keep the structure of a social safety net intact.\par \par \uc2 SRISKANDARAJAH: Yes, look, there is a huge dilemma, not just for the U.K., but almost all of the western world, which is that the tax system that we've built is not generating nearly enough resources for the expenditure, not just welfare, but also, you know, defense increasingly and all sorts of other things that are expected of the state and if you play it forward for the next couple of decades, given what is going on in terms of technology, demography and aging society, that gap is just going to get bigger and bigger.\par \par \uc2 In the U.K., the government's official forecaster thinks the gap between what the tax base will raise and what the government will need by 2050 goes to 20 percentage points of GDP, i.e. the government will raise 40 percent worth of GDP in taxes but need 60 percent to meet the costs of running the state as we know it.\par \par \uc2 And I think its high time we look at how to have a fundamental redesign of our tax system so that we can tax wealth, for example. You know, we are living in a time in which wealth inequality is skyrocketing, and yet governments seem unable or unwilling to be able to tax wealth or to raise other --\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: I don't have to tell you that in the largest economies, this is falling on deaf ears already.\par \par \uc2 SRISKANDARAJAH: Well, it is falling on deaf ears. But I think the economic reality is going to bite. So it is a question of when, not if, we raise taxes, particularly on wealth, but it is also other things, right? So you know, a lot of countries, the U.S. is a good example, fuel duties and other duties on fossil fuels, you know, pay for a lot of transport infrastructure. But, you know, in Europe, there is already a huge transition to zero emission vehicles, and so fuel duty revenues are falling.\par \par \uc2 The state needs to find a better way to raise resources to maintain roads and public infrastructure and so that's what I mean about a 21st Century tax system that is going to be effective in raising resources.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Danny, listen, in the midst of all of this and everyone trying to grapple with all of this, you actually are in the midst of a four-day workweek. That's how you work. You are a proponent of it as well, and yet the world is finding out that in the world of A.I., keeping work and finding work, even, it really mimics like a "Survivor" island episode here.\par \par \uc2 Do you think in this \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  that you and I were just discussing, limited resources, what is the virtue of a four-day workweek in that?\par \par \uc2 SRISKANDARAJAH: Well, look, first of all, we do need to acknowledge for a lot of people in a lot of parts of the world, life is particularly tough at the moment, it feels insecure. And that's why cuts to the welfare system is exactly the sort of wrong sort of thing we need to do.\par \par \uc2 But then again, if you think about what's going to happen in the way that technology will change our working lives, the sort of 20th Century assumption that we all turn up to work and work five days a week, and, you know, and productivity decline in the way that we did in the 20th Century is no longer going to hold.\par \par \uc2 You know, A.I. is already transforming the way that many industries work and I think we need to think about fundamentally different ways of organizing work. One of those is a four-day working week. You know, it was only about a century ago that in many parts of the world, workers were having to work six days a week, then it dropped to five days a week and I think it is only inevitable.\par \par \uc2 The good news is, productivity is on the rise. You know, I manage a team of 40 odd people who seem incredibly happy, but also, importantly, more productive. And, you know, with less burnout and less stress. And I think that's the sort of future we need to be thinking about and then redesign a society and economy and a state around that, rather than somehow pretend that we can keep all that was there in the 20th Century for decades to come.\par \par \uc2 [16:25:01]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Danny Sriskandarajah, a provocative conversation. Your book is "Power to the People." It is about reimagining democracy in the 21st Century. I thank you for a conversation that we know will continue. Appreciate it.\par \par \uc2 Now, Russia launched a ferocious air assault against Ukraine for a second straight night. CNN crews in Kyiv, in fact, caught the attack on video. You can see the explosions lighting up the sky there. At least two people were killed.\par \par \uc2 Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, met with Italian Prime Minister \uc2 Giorgia Meloni\uc2  in Rome. Miss Meloni floated the possibility of tougher sanctions on Russia. And in London, British Prime Minister \uc2 Keir Starmer\uc2  and French President \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2  held a call with other allies. Mr. Macron says Russia needs to be forced to the negotiating table.\par \par \uc2 Nic Robertson is in London.\par \par \uc2 Nic, if only it was that simple. You know, this Coalition of the Willing seems now to be more deliberate and robust, but how do you see their approach toward Russia changing?\par \par \uc2 NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: I think they've come out of the sort of darkness, if you will, the shadows of what they've been planning. The Coalition of the Willing really jumped up and became a big thing after President Zelenskyy had that horrific meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office in late March -- in late February, rather, and \uc2 Keir Starmer\uc2  and \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2  really kind of, you know, figuratively and literally put their arms around him and Ukraine and said, okay, we are going to lead the way to supporting Ukraine militarily if the United States is going to pull itself out of this equation, become more isolationist.\par \par \uc2 But they did do one thing, this Coalition of the Willing didn't kind of get in the way of President Trump and his efforts to have a discussion with President Putin about a ceasefire. They kind of kept their powder dry, if you will. But what they've done now is put on the table something that is really going to -- irritate is probably an understatement of what it is going to do to President Putin.\par \par \uc2 What they've said is that come a ceasefire, within hours, they want to have a military force ready to go in to help reconstitute, reinvigorate, strengthen Ukraine's military through training, through armaments, make its skies defensible with coalition aircraft, they say. So they're putting on the table here a position that they've been working on behind-the-scenes. There would even be a two-star general go and set up office in Kyiv to kind of oversee this force, a three-star general, initially in Paris, so all of this is new positioning.\par \par \uc2 But the way they announced it today was actually in conjunction for the first time, the Coalition of the Willing had a U.S. official participant, Keith Kellogg, plus a couple of U.S. senators. Keith Kellogg by the way, President Trump's special envoy on Ukraine. So there was some signaling in there that there was kind of U.S. buy-in and we know that President Trump has been getting frustrated with President Putin.\par \par \uc2 Does it really mean a change in position? Perhaps it just narrows down the negotiating space that President Trump has with Putin, but I think a lot of people would say that Putin has been playing Trump along because he wanted to have a summer offensive, and he has bought the time to do that.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: You know, as well it was discussed and it does relate directly back to Russia, among other countries, a nuclear deterrent for both France and the U.K. and the rest of Europe, for that matter that is not as reliant on the United States. The details of this are also starting to come together. What more did you learn?\par \par \uc2 ROBERTSON: Yes, this is again, a robust position by the Europeans, for the Europeans, a message not only to President Putin, but really one to President Trump, who really questioned whether the U.S. nuclear deterrent would be available for \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies as part of Article V, which really got the U.K. and France, the two nuclear powers in Europe, to kind of look at each other and go, well, that's on us. So what they've announced here is that they will join their nuclear deterrents together to protect Europe if Europe comes under significant threat, a threat that they would define.\par \par \uc2 But I think it was also interesting that in the press conference today that \uc2 Keir Starmer\uc2  had with \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2 , Macron spoke about that this is -- they are still sovereign states, that they can still make sovereign decisions. So although they're coalescing forces, coming together on this point, there is still this strong national narrative.\par \par \uc2 That said, it is still a move in the direction of a stronger European military cohesion that's been so long under discussion, you know, to protect themselves to help bolster Ukraine, but also clearly in the growing absence of a strong U.S. commitment to European partners, and I think that is a signal of a change that's happening, part of a process, not everything yet, only a small step, but it is a direction.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Yes and it might be -- it might look substantially different in a year or two in terms of what we were used to in the post-Cold War era. Nic Robertson for us, thanks so much.\par \par \uc2 Now, a new report finds tourists are still shying away from the United States. We will break down the latest travel patterns. That's next.\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 [16:30:24]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Hello, I'm Paula Newton and there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment when Richard Quest gives us a glimpse inside New York's legendary Waldorf Astoria Hotel after a multiyear renovation. And $10 million for a handbag? Yes. One of the most famous handbags in the world has just been auctioned off in Paris. Before that, though, the headlines this hour.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. judge has issued a nationwide block against President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's order seeking to end birthright citizenship. Now last month, the Supreme Court limited judges from issuing nationwide orders, though it did leave in an exemption -- an exception, pardon me, for class action lawsuits, as in this case. The Trump administration will be able to appeal.\par \par \uc2 Overnight, Moscow launched one of its fiercest attacks on Kyiv. Dramatic images show an intense Russian bombardment targeting the capital. Ukrainian officials say at least two people were killed and more than a dozen wounded.\par \par \uc2 Ten people have been rescued from the Red Sea after a Houthi attack sank their ship near Yemen. That's according to the E.U.'s Maritime Security Mission. Three people on board were killed. The U.S. mission to Yemen is accusing Houthis of kidnaping some of the remaining crew members.\par \par \uc2 Delta Airlines\uc2  restored its profit outlook for the year. Off an earnings beat, shares rallied 12 percent to its highest level since March. Investor confidence gave other airlines a boost as well.\par \par \uc2 [16:35:04]\par \par \uc2 Now, in April, you'll remember \uc2 Delta\uc2  was the first major U.S. carrier to pull its forecast due to economic uncertainty. Now, CEO \uc2 Ed Bastian\uc2  says bookings have stabilized, in his words, as travelers start coming back.\par \par \uc2 Now, overall, new data is showing that the U.S. is struggling to attract tourists from overseas. Visits fell 3.4 percent in June year over year. Trips from 11 of the top visiting countries stalled last month. Tourists from Germany down 3.7 percent, France 5.5 percent. Ecuador had the steepest drop at 14 percent.\par \par \uc2 Skift editor-in-chief Sarah Kopit joins us now.\par \par \uc2 Good to see you. The headlines were dire this spring, and visits to the U.S. we can see in the data, right, they fall, and those didn't even include Canada and Mexico. And those were also down as well.\par \par \uc2 Do you feel like we have reached a bottom here? And is that why Delta, for instance, is more bullish?\par \par \uc2 SARAH KOPIT, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SKIFT: Well, Delta flies out of the United States, too. So I'm not ready to call the bottom yet. Look, Brand USA, both the destination marketing organization which is responsible for bringing tourists to the United States, and just the wider brand of the United States of America is really hurting right now. What we saw this past month is really now a trend, right? It started in March when we had very steep declines in inbound tourists. It continued in May and now in June.\par \par \uc2 So it's not a one off, it's really happening. The rest of the world is -- they're really not as interested in coming here right now.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: And you mentioned it yourself, right? It's a branding and marketing problem. I mean, look, if you speak to people and I'm sure you have anecdotally, they do not feel that the United States is a safe place for non-citizens right now, whether that's true or not, but are also visitors finding it difficult to secure visas?\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Yes, some of them definitely are. I mean, the immigration policy of the United States right now has made just the welcoming of people who are not citizens of the United States of America, it is more difficult to come here, both from paperwork at the border. We've seen it over and over again in -- since January, since the Trump administration took office.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, when you're coming on vacation, when you're coming inbound, you're going to take your family, you're going to take a trip, really, truly, you want to go somewhere where you feel welcome, and what travelers are telling us with their dollars, with their pocketbooks, is that they don't feel welcome here in the United States.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Sarah, what are the repercussions of this for so many in the United States? And is it falling on deaf ears in the Oval Office?\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Yes. So the one thing that I don't think a lot of people realize is just how big of a business travel and tourism is for the United States and for all of the various businesses that it touches in our economy. So right now, if this holds, the U.S. stands to lose $12.5 billion from these projections that are going on right now.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, what's going on in the Oval Office, that is anyone's guess. I don't know if they're sitting there talking about it and wondering what they can do, but they certainly are not -- haven't taken many policy moves. As a matter of fact, they just caught in the big beautiful bill, they cut Brand USA, again, that's the DMO that's responsible for marketing tourism of the United States. They cut their funding by 80 percent. So that is one signal that we're seeing out of this White House.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: So this is not an industry clearly for right now that the Trump administration is interested in supporting.\par \par \uc2 There is a little bit of good news here. These new TSA guidelines, right? We are finally, in most cases, allowed to keep our --\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Yes.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Our shoes on. With this irritant gone, you know, I am wondering what picks up the slack here. Are more, you know, Americans going to decide, OK, we can go away for the weekend, the airports not as much of a hassle as I'm used to it being?\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Well, the thing that Americans really are doing right now is taking road trips. That's one thing that we have seen really have a big resurgence is that people are getting in their car and they're driving. They're going to see other parts of the United States. I think one of the reasons for that is not so much the shoes at the airport, although a welcome change for everyone, surely. It's that people are, you know, they're weighing the economy.\par \par \uc2 You know, what's in their bank account. And then the road trip is more of the last minute decision, the last minute trip. We see this in hotels, short-term rentals, all across the board. So that's what people are doing this summer.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Sarah Kopit, we will leave it there for now, but we'll continue to check in to you -- check in with you because it is curious in the sense that this was at one point in time something American governments would welcome people and want them to vacation in the United States.\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Yes.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Appreciate your time. Thanks.\par \par \uc2 KOPIT: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 [16:40:03]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Now, the original -- the original Birkin bag has sold for more than $10 million. We'll talk about the auction of the iconic handbag that once belonged to its namesake, actress and singer Jane Birkin.\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Vampire bats, snakes, dark caves. Yes, it's already a nightmare for me because this does sound like the stuff of nightmares. But for one Mexican ecologist, you know, it's just another day in the field.\par \par \uc2 Today on "Call to Earth," we go on an adventure with Rodrigo Medellin, who, as part of the Rolex Perpetual Planet initiative, has spent the last four decades campaigning to save bats in his home country.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 RODRIGO MEDELLIN, LEAD RESEARCHER, NATIONAL AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO: This is an area of tropical forest. But this is the dry season, so you can see that the ecosystem is very, very dry. It's very, very hot. So bats are not going to be very active tonight. But this is going to help us hopefully catch two, maybe three bats. Crossing fingers.\par \par \uc2 ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mexican ecologist Rodrigo Medellin has spent more than 40 years studying, educating and campaigning to protect bats in his country.\par \par \uc2 MEDELLIN: My dedication to bats is very tightly linked to convincing other people that bats are incredibly important for your everyday well-being.\par \par \uc2 ASHER: On this trip, he's accompanied by two of his own teammates. And a group of local students, educators and farmers who he aims to inspire through up close interactions with his favorite winged mammal.\par \par \uc2 MEDELLIN: This is the mustached bat.\par \par \uc2 [16:45:02]\par \par \uc2 This is a very common insectivorous species from all of tropical Mexico, Central America, and South America. As you can see, it has really beautiful wings.\par \par \uc2 (Speaking in foreign language)\par \par \uc2 ASHER: Globally, bat populations are declining because of a number of threats including habitat loss, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and disease. But Rodrigo believes their biggest problem is a bad reputation.\par \par \uc2 MEDELLIN: Bats are very mysterious. Many people fear them, many people attack them, despise them. Where did it come from? Why do they have that negative public image? Very likely it has something to do with an incredible novel called "Dracula," written by Bram Stoker in the 1800s.\par \par \uc2 (Through translator): It's the furry-legged vampire bat. Look at his hairy legs. Can you see? The furry legged vampire bat.\par \par \uc2 Bats are certainly not more full of diseases than your dog or your cat, so that has been horribly exaggerated. And the bats are the losing end of this equation. So what we do many times is just to explain to people that bats are not dangerous.\par \par \uc2 This is a baby nectar feeding bat. For the moment, it's safe, but there's more than 100 snakes around it. Any second one of them can come and grab it.\par \par \uc2 One of my projects is to document the ecosystem services provided by bats all around the world. This time, we're surrounded by many thousands of bats that feed on insects, nectar and pollen from flowers, and fruit. Those three provide incredible ecosystem services for all of us.\par \par \uc2 ASHER: In other words, bats help control pests, disperse seeds, and pollinate key crops here and across the planet.\par \par \uc2 MEDELLIN: Mexico is a very lucky country. We are one of the very few mega diversity countries. That is an incredible privilege, but also an amazing responsibility for all of Mexicans. We need to defend our nature, our biodiversity and our bats. They are amazing and they give you benefits every day of our lives.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Now let us know what you're doing to answer the call with the hashtag "Call to Earth."\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 [16:50:33]\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: One of the most famous handbags in the world has just been auctioned off in Paris. The original Birkin bag has sold for $10 million. And yes, you guessed it, it makes it the most expensive handbag ever to sell at auction.\par \par \uc2 Now it belonged to its namesake, actress and singer Jane Birkin, who died in 2023. Before her passing, she spoke with CNN's Christiane Amanpour about the bag's legacy.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 JANE BIRKIN, ACTRESS AND SINGER: It was funny to come to New York and they said, oh, Birkin, like the bag? I said, yes, now the bag is going to sing.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: That's a good one.\par \par \uc2 BIRKIN: Lou told me that people say to her, you mean you're the daughter of the bag? So I thought, oh, bless me, you know, when I'm dead, then when I'm dead, then not only is it "Je T'aime Moi Non Plus," but it will possibly even only talk about the bag.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: That is not true, is it, Anna Stewart? She is accomplished in her own right. But the story of the Birkin, legend.\par \par \uc2 ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, this is a hallowed story now and fashion lore. She inspired this bag by just happening to meet up with the CEO of \uc2 Hermes\uc2  at the time on a flight to Paris and complained because her handbag just wasn't fitting all of her documents, complained it wasn't functional enough, so they scribbled on the back of some sort of serviette or maybe even a sick bag a pattern for this bag. And this is the OG.\par \par \uc2 Now what you get for just over $10 million, Paula, is not just this bag, but you get all the scratches, the scuffs, the sort of sticky residue from stickers in the past that go along with it. Not really what you expect to buy for $10 million, but of course that is all part of the story. And what I kind of love about this bag and have increasingly loved through the day where I've been telling this story, is just the fact that this was quite a loved and very used bag.\par \par \uc2 She had it on the floor. She had it filled with stuff. These days you buy a Birkin and it ends up, you know, behind a piece of glass at home and occasionally goes out and sits on a handbag stool in a restaurant.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: You're right. It's almost like an extension of your personality at this point. And in terms of it being a cultural touch point, right, Anna, it really is like that for so many people now, men and some, sorry, women and some men, even.\par \par \uc2 STEWART: Absolutely. And you know what, Paula? There is an argument. There is an argument for buying a Birkin bag increasingly so I find because actually it really does hold its value. Now, new, this bag in 1984 was worth $2,000. Now it's more like $13,000, but actually it's the secondary market where the value absolutely skyrockets because there aren't enough of them. The clients that \uc2 Hermes\uc2  will sell to is really limited.\par \par \uc2 So this is a study between 1980 and 2015. You will see the Birkin increased in value by 14.2 percent a year, outpacing the S&P, outpacing gold. I wish I had a more recent study for you, but you know, not enough banks are focusing on a Birkin as alternative investment. But there you go. There is value in it.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: OK.\par \par \uc2 STEWART: And I just wonder if we see this sell again, will it sell for more than $10 million?\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: But you and I both know after what happened today, that in fact that value has gone up. I take your point. Maybe this facts and figures aren't recent enough, but, yes, it makes such a good point about how this is actually an investment.\par \par \uc2 What we need to do, Anna, is find the next Birkin bag, and to that point, I will give you my carry bag. I'm never sure of advice for you. OK. Now, look, I just want to -- this is washable, OK? I can't tell you what's on the cover. It's very sturdy and very washable. Only about 45 American dollars.\par \par \uc2 STEWART: Nice.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: And the reason I point this out, that the Birkin maybe does belong in a museum. And why? Because I floated around London with a beautiful Italian number for five years and got a frozen shoulder from how much I carried in it so it's just a piece of advice. I think the Birkin should stay, you know, at the auction house, and then in a special place in your home. Don't carry it around. It can be dangerous to your health.\par \par \uc2 STEWART: You know, I didn't buy it, Paula. That wasn't me.\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: I better not be, Anna. After all we've spoken about.\par \par \uc2 Anna Stewart, for us, fascinating really. I really, I didn't know that about the value. So thank you very much. Appreciate it.\par \par \uc2 Now we are talking about luxury again. And when it comes to luxury real estate in New York, a classic is coming back in style. The iconic Waldorf Astoria is opening its doors for the first time since beginning renovations in 2017, and it's betting big on luxury real estate. Now the hotel has downsized from 1400 guest rooms to just about 700 rooms, half of which are luxury condos.\par \par \uc2 Now, the property's general manager showed Richard Quest, one of the residences on sale for, oh, you know, just about $12 million.\par \par \uc2 [16:55:06]\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 LUIGI ROMANIELLO, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WALDORF ASTORIA NEW YORK: It's a residential lobby so when you come in, you have your private concierge, of course. Of course we have our team.\par \par \uc2 RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: So the elevators to the residences.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: Are not the same as the resident -- for the hotel?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: No. They're separate. They're separate. So we have a bank of elevators just for the residents.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: So did you have to put in -- did you have to put in new elevators?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: We had to put all new elevators in.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: Really?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: For the residents. Yes. This was an incredible, you know, when you, when you look --\par \par \uc2 QUEST: So you must have just gutted the place?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: We gutted the entire thing.\par \par \uc2 Well, we wanted to, first of all, we wanted to reduce the size of the hotel, you know, because we used to have 1400 rooms before, so now we are down to 375 rooms, so we can have best deliver the service and really give that ultra luxury Waldorf Astoria New York service we're famous for. And then we want to do for the very, very first time in the history of Waldorf Astoria in New York, now you can have an opportunity to actually owned one of the residents.\par \par \uc2 You know, before we used to have, you know, long term residents, as you heard. You know, I was looking at, you know, Cole Porter, 30 years he lived here. Can you imagine that? And -- but it was always like, almost like a lease long term stay. But now you can actually physically own one of the beautiful residences.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: It's not cheap though, is it?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: This one over here is Josh Green. You know, and it's a three- bedroom. Yes. This one goes for about $12 million, all decorated. But we have price points for every single audience.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: When the hotel opens, you're right, it's going to be a lot smaller therefore a lot more expensive and exclusive in a sense. Higher up, higher up the chain. But this place also was very well known for its banqueting, its events, ladies in long gowns and --\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: Of course, of course.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: Walking up and down. Is that going to be part of the future?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: The grand ballroom is like the crown jewel of Waldorf Astoria New York. I mean, it is the crown jewel and it's got that kind of statement. And yes, we will bring back all the galas, all, you know, the events that the Waldorf Astoria used to celebrate.\par \par \uc2 QUEST: Because the Waldorf is so well known. How aware are you of its history and its character?\par \par \uc2 ROMANIELLO: I feel like I've been preparing all my life for this job. You know, it's so meaningful to me just to see the love that New Yorkers have for this hotel, you know? And by the way, I'm going to be living in the hotel, so I'm going to be living in one of the residences. So I'm going to be very, very close to my team members, you know, to my guests, to my owners. They're going to make a life and be here, you know? So this is going to be the most incredible journey of my life.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEOTAPE)\par \par \uc2 NEWTON: Our thanks to Richard there. Couldn't we move the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS office there as well?\par \par \uc2 I'm Paula Newton.

\par\par \uc2 Arts\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 Power Points; Calgary filmmaker tackles energy poverty in Peru\b0\par\par\uc2 Eric Volmers \par \uc2 Calgary Herald \par \uc2 1,333 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 July 2025\par \uc2 Calgary Herald\par \uc2 CALH\par \uc2 Early\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2025 Calgary Herald \par \par \uc2 Not long after Matt Embry posted his documentary Help Is On the Way on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , he received two "scathing" comments on the same day.\par \par \uc2 They were from opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to the debate over fossil fuels and the response to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. One was clearly from supporters of "renewable side of the argument" and one from people on the "conventional energy side."\par \par \uc2 No one wishes for scathing reviews, of course. But, in a strange way, it did make the Calgary filmmaker feel like he had done his job.\par \par \uc2 "I thought 'wow, we made a movie that both sides are really paying attention to,'" says Embry. "I'm politically agnostic. I try to make my films as politically agnostic as possible and talk about the facts."\par \par \uc2 Help is On the Way is about energy poverty and features Embry and his team embarking on an often perilous trek to the Peruvian Andes to talk to community members who live without easy access to heat, light and power. The film follows a group that includes Calgary students Kalista McNabb and Pavneet Cheema and Light Up the World executive director Aaron Cohen to a remote village in Peru called Huarcaya, where they oversee an ambitious project to bring solar power to a community that includes the area's only school. That portion of the film is overseen by Mykola Pelikov, a Ukrainian filmmaker who works for Embry's Muster Point Productions and had his own experiences with energy poverty in his home country. Embry and a separate crew head up the mountains to a village called Ancallachi to interview community members about the effects of not having access to heat, light and power.\par \par \uc2 Still, while Embry maintains that the film "isn't about politics," it does eventually touch on contentious issues such as the building of pipelines and the manner and speed in which governments are battling \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't want a film made up of talking heads, the trip to Peru and all its inherent difficulties is a major part of Help in On The Way.\par \par \uc2 "With all my films, I try to give people access to places and people they could never have in dayto-day life," says Embry. "I love adventure. That's what I want for audiences, to bring them with us. Energy issues can be challenging to share in an entertaining way. What I try to find is storylines about people who are doing things in the energy space that are compelling. Light Up the World, for me, was an organization that was doing the work and actually having real tangible, hopeful results. Which was key because I don't like making movies that don't have solutions, or at least try to suggest possible solutions we can discuss."\par \par \uc2 The trip to Peru, which took place last February, didn't lack in adventure. The two film crews travel along perilously thin mountain roads. At one point, the bus one crew is travelling in gets stuck in an area. There's a flat tire on another trip. At one point, a woman asks the filmmakers to take her and her baby to the hospital.\par \par \uc2 The biggest drama unfolds when Embry is en route to Ancallachi and they learn that a landslide has wiped out the roads leading to the village.\par \par \uc2 "As a documentary filmmaker, you can only predict maybe 25 per cent of what is going to happen," Embry says. "For me, it's about making sure we're safe and making sure we are surrounded by the right people, the experts, and we're going to be pointing the camera at the story we are trying to cover and I just allow the story and the scenes to unfold. There is not question there are moments where you wonder if we are able to keep filming or keep going. But I just trust the process. There are so many times, like a flat tire or having a road washed out, where it opens it up to a whole different part of the story and a character who can show us something different. The day we had the washed-out road was a scary one. Our camera operator and me to a certain extent were struggling with the altitude and not feeling that great to be able to walk in there; plus the rain, plus the washed-out road. There was terrain I'm not familiar with. So I would ask simple questions. If something happened, could we get a helicopter in here? The answer was no because there was too much fog. So your mind starts to do the calculus: What situation are we in? But you're trying your absolute best to tell the story and there are some dangers involved. But, again, when it comes to energy poverty, this is a life and death situation."\par \par \uc2 The film includes some of those sad life-and-death stories from the Peruvian areas the film visits. Key to the film is Kevin Quillahuaman, a Peruvian guide who is particularly adept at getting the crews access to remote areas and people but also has a backstory about the perils of living without stable access to energy. To show that energy poverty also happens in our own country, Embry also visits Blaine Chislett in a remote area of Nunavut. Chiselett is an Inuk activist working to reduce diesel dependency in his community.\par \par \uc2 Embry has mixed personal stories into his films before, including his own. In 2017's award-winning Living Proof, he chronicled his experiences with multiple sclerosis and promoted the methods he has used to combat it, which mostly involved diet and exercise. It wasn't without controversy, as Embry targeted not only the pharmaceutical companies but also charities such as Multiple Sclerosis of Canada.\par \par \uc2 But Help in on the Way is a followup to Embry's 2019 documen- tary Global Warning, which was essentially an oil industry-boosting film that argued, among other things, that the science behind man-made \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change has yet to be settled. The film featured Patrick Moore, the controversial former president of \uc2 Greenpeace Canada\uc2  who now criticizes the environmental movement and has become a corporate consultant.\par \par \uc2 Future Alberta Premier \uc2 Danielle Smith\uc2 , who was a conservative radio host at the time and anything but "politically agnostic", was also consulted for Global Warning.\par \par \uc2 Moore again appears in Help is on the Way, as does \uc2 Bjorn Lomborg\uc2 . The Danish political scientist and author is an equally polarizing figure known for his controversial 2001 book The Skeptical Environmentalist, which challenged the scientific consensus on \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and questioned the widely held belief that the global \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is getting progressively worse. Embry says landing Lomborg, who he calls "a huge international name," was a significant coup for the film. The film embraces his idea that conventional energy is still vital, particularly when it comes to addressing energy poverty around the globe.\par \par \uc2 "In the film I tried my absolute best to walk both sides and show how a blend of conventional energy and renewables is the path forward today and we can actually do something about it," Embry says. " Viewers will make up their own minds, of course, and can watch Help is On the Way for free on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . Embry, who has made documentaries in the past about Theo Fleury, Ian Tyson and Jann Arden, says he made the film through public donations and was adamant about keeping it independent.\par \par \uc2 "I'm able to distribute my films completely independently," he says. "This model, for me, is incredible because it gives me such autonomy in my storytelling. For me, it's the path forward."\par \par \uc2 To watch Help is on the Way, visit {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.CanadaCanHelp.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.CanadaCanHelp.com}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Embry has also set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money to help Light Up the World bring electricity and internet access to Ancallachi, Peru.\par \par \uc2 Document CALH000020250710el7a0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

Back then, coral ecosystems were more colorful, abundant and rich. There was no talk yet of coral bleaching, hard coral tissue loss disease or oceans with temperatures of up to 32.2 \u176\'00\'B0C (90 \u176\'00\'B0F). Much has happened since then. "I saw the reef when it was beautiful," says Alvarado, known among biologists and scientists in the country as 'the mother of Colombia's corals'.\par \par \uc2 READ ALSO.\par \par \uc2 Over the years, Alvarado has dedicated her entire life to the \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , protection and restoration of "the jungle of the oceans", the corals. Much of that effort was presented on Wednesday, July 9, before a packed auditorium at the Maloka museum in Bogota, in the short documentary film 'CoralTheca: Elvira's legacy to the Colombian Caribbean reefs', a production that seeks to raise public awareness of the urgency of the struggle to restore coral reefs in Colombia through Elvira's story.In a world increasingly threatened by \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, where rising sea temperatures are pushing corals to the brink of collapse, this collaborative production led by Pavoreal Films portrays Elvira's tireless work, and focuses on the innovative CoralTheca project, developed in conjunction with organizations such as Parques Nacionales Naturales, Diving Life, Agenda del Mar, Perry Institute, Diving Planet, among others.Through this program, a rescue center and a genetic bank of corals has been built in the National Natural Park Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo Islands, with the aim of saving coral species - which are invertebrate animals formed by polyps that are grouped in colonies - and encourage the reproduction of new colonies through advanced techniques of sexual reproduction. The documentary not only shows my work, but that of a group called CoralTheca, where we are many people who have been building for years. It's a retribution to the passion and education that have always been my focus for reefs and coastal marine ecosystems," says Elvira in an interview.READ ALSO\par \par \uc2 The screening of the short film was held in front of a diverse audience that included marine biologists, scientists, environmental activists, the curious about the sea and, especially, dozens of children accompanied by their parents, interested in the marine world. Although it has only been screened twice in Bogot\u225\'00\'E1, the film has already been nominated for the Santiago Wild Nature and \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Film Festival, a distinction that confirms the urgency and beauty of its message. Global warming has already reached a critical point. Even if we decide tomorrow to stop burning fossil fuels, temperatures are so high and frequent that they will not recede. One of the pillars of CoralTheca, as a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  project, is the sexual reproduction of corals, a technique less explored than asexual reproduction through fragmentation, but key to strengthening the genetic diversity and resilience of these ecosystems. "Sexual reproduction initiatives are the ones that are going to manage to perhaps grow those individuals that could maintain the reefs, not as they were before, but as we need them to be: functional. For coastal protection, for food, for food security," explains the scientist, whose concern is shared by the global scientific community. According to the \uc2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\uc2 , the planet is going through the fourth massive coral bleaching event in history - the second in the last decade - caused by rising ocean temperatures. More than 90 % of the oceans recorded heat waves in 2023, according to the \uc2 World Meteorological Organization\uc2  WMO.These abnormal temperature increases induce stress in corals, leading them to expel zooxanthellae -microalgae essential for their nutrition and color-, resulting in the phenomenon known as coral bleaching. This not only threatens marine biodiversity, but also millions of people who depend on reefs for fishing, tourism and coastal protection.ALSO READ.\par \par \uc2 "We are late, we are slow and we are small scale," Elvira acknowledges, referring to current \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts. However, CoralTheca represents a clear sign that Colombia is waking up to this environmental emergency, and in her final message, the biologist emphasizes the importance of educating from childhood. "Children are sponges. They are the ones to whom we must give priority information and training," she says, while celebrating the fact that they were the protagonists of the audience in Maloka.CoralTheca is not only a portrait of an admirable scientist, but a powerful tool to understand that it is still possible to act.EDWIN CAICEDO \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Health Journalist@CaicedoUcros\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250710el7a0098v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

The popularity of this advocate - she worked for a law firm with no formal legal training - was captured in the movie that bears her name, starring Julia Roberts. Brockovich has participated in the Healthy Cities initiative of the medical insurer Sanitas, which has reached its tenth edition with challenges to make cities more sustainable and improve people's health.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change "It will bring problems related to water: too much, too little or none at all."It's not easy, but how to achieve healthier cities?\par \par \uc2 As we see \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions changing, I don't think we can continue to rely on outdated and obsolete infrastructure, and cities and governments should invest money to better protect and defend us from environmental attacks.\par \par \uc2 What about the individual?\par \par \uc2 It is very important, regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, to have your own personal preparedness plan to protect and defend your family and property. That's why I wrote Superman's not coming about a national water crisis. Pay attention to what's going on around you. We're too busy staring at the phone. Don't think that any agency or person is going to do it for you.\par \par \uc2 Is it easier now, or harder, to hold big business accountable for environmental damage?\par \par \uc2 It may be harder right now, and there are many factors that play into that, such as state laws. But in my book I explain how I've seen the biggest changes start with a group of very well-organized angry mothers because they were hurting their child. It wasn't federal policy or, frankly, state policies that changed what happened in Hinkley-the community you championed in the film.\par \par \uc2 What is the biggest challenge to the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the world?\par \par \uc2 I think it's our own individual perception. We assume that someone is going to fix it for us, and I think that will be the biggest challenge, as well as verifying the actual information.\par \par \uc2 Do you get anonymous phone calls like in the film?\par \par \uc2 Very strange things happened when I was doing my job back in the 1990s. Watching to see if I'm in danger or not. I don't always take it seriously. I know when I'm in a serious situation and respond accordingly.\par \par \uc2 Are you working on any relevant cases now?\par \par \uc2 If there's one thing that could end my career, when I retire, it will be around the timeless chemicals, PFASs, because it's a global problem, water, land and the food chain, so I think it will be my life's work.\par \par \uc2 Is it all about water?\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change will bring water issues: too much, too little or none, and we can't survive without water. We are water, so I worry about what's to come. When I started my work at Hinkley, I asked myself, "What is the common denominator that affects all animals, all wildlife, all vegetation and people?" And I realized, "My God, it's water." The most necessary element for life.\par \par \uc2 We have another new problem with water consumption in AI data centers.\par \par \uc2 It's a future problem. I'm getting a lot of inquiries about it. I'm working with a lot of specialists and scientists on it. We have aquifers in the United States that are predicted to dry up and disappear, by 2030-2035. What we are seeing locally is that people are rebelling against building these big data centers in their cities, which will suck up their valuable water resources.\par \par \uc2 Are there solutions for large-scale industrial development without polluting the water?\par \par \uc2 Well, yes, I have a lot of conversations about fracking, because it can pollute water. There is a lot of scope for companies to do the right thing and protect water. The goal is to reduce chemicals in the water. And it's about money, about saving.\par \par \uc2 It's been 25 years since the film was shot, how did it all change?\par \par \uc2 Oh my gosh. Yes. I can't believe it's been 25 years. I started my job in that little desert town. I was 31 years old - 39 when it was shot. Now I'm 64 and a grandmother of four grandchildren, and sometimes I can't believe it. I didn't see it coming, but what I learned from Erin Brockovich is that it's not about me, Erin Brockovich. It's about all of us. The idea of Erin Brockovich lives inside all of us. And all of the environmental cases I've been involved in start with an angry mother. When they get organized, they are very powerful. It makes me think of the book The Wizard of O z, which spawned the movie, that we may have been asleep in poppy fields, but when we wake up, we will learn the message of the book. We are the people. You've always had heart, you've always had brains and you've always had courage, now use them. That's where I think we are.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250710el7a005nn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw127\pich40\picscaley313\picscalex313\picwgoal610\pichgoal192

The Cannes prize winner Resurrection sounds equally enigmatic: a 160-minute epic set in a future where humans no longer dream, though a group of fringe rebels defy the odds. The film traverses Chinese national history as well as cinematic lineage; by all accounts, it sounds suitably deranged. \u8211\'20\'13 Michael Sun\par \par \uc2 If I Had Legs I\u8217\'20\'19d Kick You\par \par \uc2 Director: Mary Bronstein\par \par \uc2 Country: US\par \par \uc2 Related: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/24/if-i-had-legs-id-kick-you-review-rose-byrne"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 If I Had Legs I\u8217\'20\'19d Kick You review \u8211\'20\'13 Rose Byrne is a knockout in anxious dark comedy}}}\par \par \uc2 Who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have time for Rose Byrne?

The film, directed by filmmaker Laurent Bouzereau, premieres July 10, 2025 on \uc2 Disney\uc2 + Latin America, and reveals never-before-seen aspects of the creation of the film that changed the history of science fiction cinema.\par \par \uc2 "Much has been said and done about 'Jaws.' Will there be room for another documentary about the film? We wondered with Steven Spielberg. Frankly, we decided there was," says Bouzereau, who connected in an exclusive interview with El Comercio's Saltar Intro. Due to his collaboration with the "E.T." and "Jurassic Park" filmmaker's production company, Amblin Documentaries, the French documentarian had access to personal archives of his colleague and Peter Benchley, the author of the original "Jaws" novel.\par \par \uc2 LOOK: Up to 57% discount on the best in entertainment. See all promotions hereBouzereau's film, distributed by National Geographic on \uc2 Disney\uc2 +, includes new interviews with Spielberg himself. "When the shark built failed, I thought this film would be the last film I would make before the movies stopped hiring me," the "Jaws" director says in the documentary. Over the course of the documentary, the behind-the-scenes footage is interwoven with a contemporary focus on marine \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the film's cultural legacy, and includes archival interviews with members of the original cast, such as Richard Dreyfuss, and other guests, including \uc2 George Lucas\uc2 , James Cameron, Emily Blunt and present-day Guillermo del Toro. Family members of writer Peter Benchley also participated, including his widow Wendy Benchley, who is an executive producer, and his children Tracy and Clayton.\par \par \uc2 Steven Spielberg's adversities in "Jaws".Filmed under extreme conditions, Spielberg faced countless technical, logistical and human obstacles. Then just 27 years old, he had to deal with the pressure of adapting a publishing hit in a short time, when people were wary that he would be able to finish his own film. "When they initially thought they would have months to build a shark or the several sharks they needed, they actually had two or three months, which was impossible," Bouzereau explains. "So they jumped in pretty quickly. But I think they didn't have to think about everything that could go wrong," he adds.\par \par \uc2 During the open-ocean shoot, the mechanical shark constantly malfunctioned, weather conditions caused delays, and tensions arose between actors. "As they started shooting it, they realized it was going to be a nightmare. And I think what happened then was, 'Steven's not going to quit, he's going to get fired.' There was a lot of drama around it," adds the documentary's director.\par \par \uc2 In that chaotic context, Spielberg managed to overcome the stress, doubts and pressure from the studio. "I think my documentary is about perseverance in the face of the worst adversity. And I find it very inspiring, because it's time to want to do something and it's easy to give up. Well, in this case, you don't quit," Bouzereau reflects. "I thought the message of never giving up, as illustrated by Steven Spielberg and the creation of 'Jaws,' was really beautiful for people," he adds.\par \par \uc2 LOOK: Concerts, plays, circuses, movies and more with up to 50% off.

According to Bouzereau, the plot that shows a mayor refusing to close the beaches, despite the threat of the shark, is a direct metaphor for the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  of distrust that the United States was experiencing after the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal during the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 "In the movie and the book of 'Jaws,' it talks about authority and how we can't trust it. And after Nixon was out, people in real life were questioning: wait a minute, these people are supposed to be our leaders, but they're lying to us?" says Bouzereau of a time when Spielberg's film was the subject of frequent political cartoons and satire.\par \par \uc2 From thriller to ecological inspirationBut "Jaws at 50: The Definitive Secret History" goes beyond the behind-the-scenes. The documentary explores how the initial fear generated by the shark gave way to a scientific admiration for this unjustly demonized marine species. With interviews with experts such as Philippe Cousteau, Gibbs Kuguru and Dr. John Mandelman of the New England Aquarium, it looks at the change in public perception generated by the film over time.\par \par \uc2 "We did an incredible collaboration with NatGeo and decided to include this discussion about ocean \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and sharks, something that had not been addressed in the context of the movie 'Jaws,'" says Bouzereau. "The goal was to inspire younger generations to watch it or revisit it with new perspectives, both from scientists and young filmmakers," explains Laurent.\par \par \uc2 "We'll all turn 50 just once," he jokes. For all its technologically dated sci-fi cinema, Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" will never go out of style. Last month alone, when it premiered on NBC in the U.S., it surprised with its audience of 3 million viewers. And we're talking about a movie from the 1970s! Made with a mechanical animal without much post-production. But, as the documentary suggests, the story behind "Jaws" is not just that of a film shoot with shortcomings, but a work that put perseverance first, that transformed fear into fascination and that turned a young director into a legend.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250708el78008m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

You walk along an elevated walkway, with the flat Cordoba countryside at your feet. You enter the plane, but there are no flight attendants or seat belts. Instead of cramped seats, a king-size bed, a Jacuzzi on the balcony and state-of-the-art technology await you. You won't take off, but you will fly.\par \par \uc2 This movie scenario is real. This is the first hotel in Argentina -and one of the few in the world- that offers accommodation inside airplanes transformed into rooms.\par \par \uc2 It is in Oncativo, in the department of R\u237\'00\'EDo Segundo, just two kilometers from the C\u243\'00\'F3rdoba-Rosario highway.\par \par \uc2 The project is as unprecedented as it is ambitious, and arouses the curiosity of all those who hear about it for the first time.\par \par \uc2 The first airplane hotel in Argentina\par \par \uc2 The architect of this originality is Oscar Scorza, an industrial entrepreneur from Oncativo, owner in that city of Econovo, a company specialized in urban hygiene machinery.\par \par \uc2 Beyond his technical profile, Scorza has an innovative streak that led him to transform his place of residence into one of the most original tourist ventures in a region that is not strictly touristic.\par \par \uc2 He had already done so in 2019 with the Campo Hotel Nono Luigi, a luxury ranch with rural touches, monumental sculptures, subway wine cellar and spa. In a campouyo, he set up a hotel.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2022, it added a bowling alley inside a disused airliner.\par \par \uc2 But now he has doubled the bet: two commercial aircraft transformed into eight VIP rooms. The new hotel was christened Air Damascus.\par \par \uc2 "The project is unique in the country and, I would say, also in the world. There are hotels with parts of airplanes, but we have two whole airplanes, with their wings, their original shape, their respected atmosphere. It's like being inside a flight that doesn't take off," Scorza explains to La Voz, as he walks through one of the cabins.\par \par \uc2 An immersive experience\par \par \uc2 Air Damasco's proposal seeks to faithfully replicate the experience of an airport: to enter the rooms you will have to walk through a chute identical to that of real boarding, including a waiting room.\par \par \uc2 From there, you access the plane through an elevated walkway, which connects to a balcony with a Jacuzzi. Yes: each suite has its own private, open-air Jacuzzi on the surface of the wings.\par \par \uc2 "It's a completely crazy thing. But it works. Everyone wants to come and see what it's like to sleep on a plane without leaving the ground," Scorza laughs.\par \par \uc2 Each plane houses four themed rooms, whose names are not random: they are inspired by the countries with which Econovo has commercial ties. Thus, one plane has rooms dedicated to India, China, Turkey and Spain (countries from which it imports machinery), and the other to the United States, Italy, Peru and Uruguay (to which it exports its products).\par \par \uc2 Smart technology and cutting-edge design\par \par \uc2 The list of features is impressive. Intelligent Japanese toilets that open their lids when they detect movement, heated seats and ozone cleaning functions, or showers with Bluetooth and ambient lights that allow you to receive calls or listen to music. There are wireless chargers, smart TVs, king-size beds (1.80 by 2 meters), designer mirrors, personalized \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  control and wifi connection.\par \par \uc2 The suites retain the spirit of the aircraft: the windows are intact, as is the curved ceiling and fuselage structure. In some rooms, guests will even be able to access the original cockpit, set as part of the tour.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't want to destroy the essence of the aircraft. On the contrary, we celebrate it. It's part of what makes this experience unique," says the creator of the hotel with wings.\par \par \uc2 Surreal transfer: airplanes on the route\par \par \uc2 The airplanes that are now in Oncativo did not fly in. They were transported by truck from the C\u243\'00\'F3rdoba airport in an operation that at the time stopped traffic and generated surprise.\par \par \uc2 "When it passed along the highway, people slowed down to film. They couldn't believe it. An airplane taxiing on wheels, but on the asphalt," Scorza recalls.\par \par \uc2 Both aircraft were acquired at a public auction in Buenos Aires in 2019, for a surprisingly low figure. "We bought three aircraft for 453,000 pesos in total, at the time. Less than what a used pickup truck goes for," he assures.\par \par \uc2 After spending years abandoned, the aircraft were offered to different buyers. Scorza, who had already used one of them as a dance club (the "1880", in honor of his great-grandfather), decided to go further and turn the other two into hotel rooms.\par \par \uc2 An \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  that enhances the experience\par \par \uc2 Although the airplane hotel is the big novelty, the Nono Luigi complex was already a special destination.\par \par \uc2 The property, which includes a restaurant, spa, farm, party room and traditional rooms, is decorated with a singular taste. Giant animal sculptures, recycled furniture, chairs brought from monasteries and a subway cellar with selected wines.\par \par \uc2 The restaurant is another strong point: it combines homemade gastronomy with products harvested in the same field.\par \par \uc2 The spa offers a dry sauna, heated pool, Jacuzzi, massages and a solarium overlooking the countryside. And the farm, with loose animals - ostriches, llamas, ducks, cows, horses - allows sulky or horseback rides.\par \par \uc2 When does it open and how much will it cost?\par \par \uc2 The opening of the rooms in the airplanes is scheduled for July 9, although guided tours or reservations for stays at the new hotel can already be made.\par \par \uc2 About the price, Scorza anticipated that they will cost 250 thousand pesos, with full breakfast included for rooms on a double basis. "What I assure is that it will be worth every peso. It is an experience that will not be repeated," he argues.\par \par \uc2 And if they ask him how much he invested, he answers with his direct style: "If I knew from the beginning how much it was going to cost me, maybe I wouldn't do it. But that's the way I am.\par \par \uc2 The truth is that it is already done. And Oncativo, that quiet town with an agricultural profile in the interior of C\u243\'00\'F3rdoba, has now become an international tourist destination, with a proposal that combines innovation, luxury, rurality... and wings.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250708el78008b2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw140\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2100\pichgoal600

They are, however, more susceptible to environmental conditions that require advanced encapsulation films with improved UV protection, thermal stability, and electrical insulation. HJT cells, which have crystalline silicon combined with hybrid amorphous silicon layers, are an example of the necessity of films to mitigate potential-induced degradation (PID).\par \par \uc2 PVB films based is anticipated to be the largest segment in photovoltaics (PV) films market, by raw material, in terms of value, during the forecast period\par \par \uc2 PVB films account for the largest share of the photovoltaic films market. The preferred choice for encapsulation films is likely a result of its excellent physical and chemical properties, and compatibility with new PV (photovoltaic) technology. PVB was first developed for laminated safety glass use in the automotive and construction industries. The films have some prized benefits, such as superior adhesion to glass, high optical clarity, and stronger protection from UV and moisture from extreme environmental conditions in regions, such as the Middle East & Africa, which relate to high heat, sand, and UV exposure. Furthermore, PVB provides structural support by enhancing the mechanical strength and impact resistance of the panel assembly, helping protect it from damage during transportation, installation, or exposure to adverse weather conditions. Much of the damage can lead to loss of efficiency and even shorten the product life of the solar panel. However, with new advances in bifacial and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) that use glass-glass module combinations, demand is expected to grow for encapsulation materials like PVB.\par \par \uc2 Request Sample Pages: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=147989535&utm_source=PRnewswire.com&utm_medium=PaidPR&utm_campaign=photovoltaicsfilmsmarket"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=147989535}}}\par \par \uc2 Ground is projected to be the largest segment in photovoltaics (PV) films market, by application, during the forecast period\par \par \uc2 Ground solar applications constitute the largest share in the application segment of the global market for photovoltaic films because the geography, infrastructure, and economy in many regions support the deployment of large-scale solar energy. Globally, semi-arid and arid land areas with low vegetation cover and minimal land-use conflicts make them suitable for utility-scale solar installations. Ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) systems and installations, particularly utility-scale solar farms, are heavily reliant on films since large quantities of encapsulation films are necessary to protect solar panels and enhance the durability and service life of solar panels that are subjected to harsh \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , energy, extreme UV radiation exposures, high temperatures, sand storms and high humidity conditions in coastal zones. Ground systems also provide optimal utilization of PV to achieve maximum energy yield with maximum power point tracking, coupled with ideal orientation/solar tracking, which is increasingly significant in areas experiencing rapid urbanization and industrialization.\par \par \uc2 Asia Pacific is expected to be the largest region in the photovoltaics (PV) films market, during the forecast period\par \par \uc2 Asia Pacific accounts for the largest share of the photovoltaic film market, owing to its strong manufacturing industries and rapidly developed solar energy sector. China, India, Japan, and South Korea continue to be leaders in deploying solar energy, with an active push to promote the use of renewable energy by the government. China is home to many of the global leaders in solar panel manufacturing, which creates great demand for encapsulation films that enclose and protect the solar cells and meet module efficiencies. Asia Pacific has local producers of encapsulation materials and a geographically well-established supply chain that enables producers to get high-quality, inexpensive substrate material. Thus, the region has heavily invested in energy security and promotes energy \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which has led to considerable utility-scale solar development and rooftop installations. Encouraging policies like subsidies and long-term solar install targets also spur momentum. Moreover, skilled labor and access to raw materials provide a competitive advantage in the supply of photovoltaic films.\par \par \uc2 Request Customization: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestCustomizationNew.asp?id=147989535&utm_source=PRnewswire.com&utm_medium=PaidPR&utm_campaign=photovoltaicsfilmsmarket"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestCustomizationNew.asp?id=147989535}}}\par \par \uc2 To enable an in-depth understanding of the competitive landscape, the report includes the profiles of some of the top players in the photovoltaics (PV) films market such as \uc2 H.B.

Building on a decades-spanning archive from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangambi#Research_center"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yangambi National Institute of Agronomic Studies and Research}}}\uc2 , the film is loosely divided into three sections, each guided by a different voice that speaks to the complicated environmental history of the area. The first segment is informed by the journal entries of Congolese agronomist Paul Panda Farnana. Working both within and outside Belgium\u8217\'20\'19s colonial control during the 1910s and 1920s, Farnana wrote of his frustration with the extractive regime, as well as meteorological statistics related to rainfall and temperature, which are narrated in voiceover. This is combined with largely static shots of present-day Congo, where vestiges of colonial buildings lie next to verdant fields, a haunting reminder from a dark past.\par \par \uc2 This cinematic link through time continues with the second narration, taken from the writing of Belgian colonial official Abiron Beirnaert. A stark contrast to Farnana\u8217\'20\'19s clear-eyed, political perspective, Beirnaert\u8217\'20\'19s contemplations luxuriate in boredom and jadedness. The images that accompany this section are also of sparsely attended archives and abandoned factories that do little to subvert Beirnaert\u8217\'20\'19s imperialist outlook. The third voice, however, grants sentience to the ancient tree of the title, bearing witness to decades of Congolese history. <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=807lZNW4HdE"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=807lZNW4HdE}}}\uc2 " > </figure>\par \par \uc2 This last is a fascinating stylistic choice that encourages us to let go of our anthropocentric approach to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, even if giving a tree an inner monologue seems to be a rather facile way to foreground non-human perspectives. Though perhaps leaning too heavily into an academic visual experiment, The Tree of Authenticity offers a fascinating look at how extraction can take many forms, even within the context of \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 The Tree of Authenticity is at the ICA from 10 July \par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020250707el770012y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw208\pich31\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3120\pichgoal465

BBC2, 7pm After setting out why heatwaves are likely to become Britain's new normal, Sarah Keith-Lucas explores the repercussions. Most alarmingly, we can expect more wildfires and a surge in heat-related deaths. The BBC weather presenter also looks at the expected impact on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , housing, workplaces, farming, transport and fire services.\par \par \uc2 The overall message? As articulated by a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  expert, it's that the UK needs a strategy for rising temperatures, rather than being merely reactive as it was in sweltering 2022. There are also two filmed segments, which at least break up the talking heads and bullet points. But they fail to add much "don't go jogging when it's super-hot" seems to be the lesson of Keith-Lucas's gym session in a "heat lab" and take up too much time in a programme lasting only 26 minutes. John Dugdale Crime Scene Cleaners Channel 4, 10pm Channel 4's series works by switching between examples of crime scene cleaners at work in the UK and America. In this case we toggle from Mark and Johnny removing blood from a \uc2 Renault\uc2  (the scene of a fatal stabbing) in a car park in west Wales, to Larry and his trainee Kelly dealing with a busted meth lab in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The contrast in interest and jeopardy is almost comical. The Welsh duo spend 17 hours meticulously scrubbing the car, having eliminated any danger of contamination. It's rather like a rogue Beckettian episode of Greg Davies's comedy The Cleaner in which no one eccentric, fanciable or suspicious interrupts the boring grind of cleaning. Whereas meth labs (as seen in Breaking Bad) may be booby-trapped, and Larry and Kelly are at risk of explosions from bottled chemical mixes described as "basically like Molotov cocktails". JD 1945-1953: From World War to Cold War PBS America, 6.30pm The famous photograph of Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 should perhaps have featured three men beaming at the imminent defeat of Nazi Germany. However, the stress on their faces reflected intense behind-the-scenes negotiations and stark ideological differences that were soon to shape the Cold War stand-off that is the subject of this engaging and informative series. Ben Dowell Billion Dollar Playground BBC3, 9pm/9.55pm An Antipodean look at the "yes, sir, no, sir, three bags full, sir" staff who attend to the mega rich. In reality it's a bit of a plug for one concierge company that delivers some diverting characters an array of butlers and sweeper-uppers working at an expensive mansion rental in Sydney. There is not enough footage of the rich people behaving indulgently, although you can see why some might have been reluctant to appear. Fun if slightly confected. BD STREAMING CHOICE We Might Regret This BBC iPlayer This racy comedy drama opens with a sex scene in which a disabled Canadian artist, Freya (the series co-creator Kyla Harris), and her boyfriend, Abe (Darren Boyd), are interrupted by her live-in PA. A little later, Freya's acerbic best friend, Jo (Elena Saurel), battles to empty her pal's bladder with a catheter. Yet in such casual, breezy ways, the depiction of disability is groundbreaking. Freya has just found work as a model, while Abe and his wife (Sally Phillips) are in therapy to navigate their divorce. Tonally, it's somewhere between Girls and There She Goes. James Jackson\par \par \uc2 FILM CHOICE The Anderson Tapes (15, 1971) Talking Pictures TV, 9.05pm Sidney Lumet's heist flick is worth watching for the score by Quincy Jones alone. Twitchy, paranoid and atmospheric, it's a superb example of film music composition. The film stars Sean Connery, taking time out from James Bond, as the career criminal Anderson. A strong cast includes Christopher Walken.

No redistribution is permitted. \par \par \uc2 Attenborough can inspire Australia-led recovery\par \par \uc2 The creator of David Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s latest documentary says Australia must urgently act to protect more of its oceans if it hopes to save our wildlife and key industries, and maintain a healthy planet into the future.\par \par \uc2 UK director and producer Toby Nowlan said his film Ocean with David Attenborough was the legendary English broadcaster\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cmost emotional, reflective and personal piece yet\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The feature-length documentary was released in May on Mr Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s 99th birthday, with a star-studded premiere attended by the King.\par \par \uc2 Mr Nowlan was in Darwin recently and told this publication Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s message \u8220\'20\'1Ccouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be more relevant for Australia\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor almost 100 years he\u8217\'20\'19s been showing us the natural world, and he\u8217\'20\'19s drawing it all together for this epic, conclusive piece to say there is nowhere more important on Earth than the ocean,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Nowlan said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we save the sea, we save our world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAustralia is in this amazing position, because it\u8217\'20\'19s got one of the most diverse coastlines on the planet \u8230\'20\'26 there\u8217\'20\'19s a lot at stake, and there\u8217\'20\'19s a lot to celebrate.\u8221\'20\'1D The documentary showcases oceans across the globe, including a mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef and blue whales migrating through Western Australia\u8217\'20\'19s Geographe Bay.\par \par \uc2 Some of the film\u8217\'20\'19s most confronting imagery exposes the impact of bottom trawlers, a method of fishing that involves dragging nets along the sea bed, often capturing large amounts of bycatch and damaging marine habitats in the process.\par \par \uc2 Trawling is common practice in Australian fisheries, but one in which the impact is often invisible to both fishers and consumers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBottom trawling is happening across the planet thousands of times every day \u8211\'20\'13 a process as common as ploughing on land, but as damaging as bulldozing your local ancient woodland,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Nowlan said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnd the reason is that people haven\u8217\'20\'19t seen it clearly, it\u8217\'20\'19s happening out of sight, out of mind, hidden from view below the waves.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s the power of film, I think, is to tell more and more of these stories.\u8221\'20\'1D Scientists agree we must protect at least 30 per cent of the world\u8217\'20\'19s oceans by 2030 to have a chance of stemming the dual crises of biodiversity loss and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister Murray Watt reaffirmed Australia\u8217\'20\'19s commitment to the 30 by 30 target at the UN Ocean Conference in France last month, raising expectations the federal government will ban trawling, fishing and drilling in more marine parks.\par \par \uc2 Mr Nowlan said witnessing the resilience of the ocean meant he came away from filming \u8220\'20\'1Cfilled with hope\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat was the most exciting thing \u8230\'20\'26 this amazing dawning realisation that the process of recovery in the ocean is really different to the process of recovery on land,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the ocean, if you seal off an area it fills up with life way more quickly, in a much more spectacular way.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we just protect a third of the ocean as a bare minimum, so much of the ocean will just fill up with life again, and we can live in a world that has more fish and bigger coastal economies and more marine life than anyone has ever dreamt possible. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd that\u8217\'20\'19s amazing, that\u8217\'20\'19s a win for everyone \u8211\'20\'13 conservationists and fisheries alike.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Northern Territory News-20250706-NTNews-5-000493558249 \par \par \uc2 Document NORTHT0020250705el7600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw243\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3645\pichgoal600

The wildlife filmmaker returns to our screens with Sharks Up Close, a new feature-length documentary for National Geographic, kicking off Sharkfest this month on Nat Geo Wild and \uc2 Disney\uc2 +.\par \par \uc2 Following on from Animals Up Close and Secrets Of The Penguins, Bertie turns his attention to the world's most misunderstood marine predator: the great white shark.\par \par \uc2 "In the world of wildlife film and ocean \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , it's no secret sharks are in serious trouble," he says. "We kill over 100 million every year. It's easy to blame the shark fin trade in Asia, but here in the UK, we kill plenty too - often as bycatch or even sold in fish and chip shops under different names."\par \par \uc2 Filmed off the coast of South Africa, Sharks Up Close sees Bertie attempt to swim with a great white - a childhood dream for many, bERTIE GREGORY but a complex and sobering mission in reality.\par \par \uc2 "I realised how at risk great whites are," Bertie says.\par \par \uc2 "They're facing a perfect storm of threats - both natural and human-made."\par \par \uc2 Among these are the controversial swimmer protection systems used in parts of South Africa.\par \par \uc2 "Baited hooks and drum lines are used to reduce human conflict, but they kill sharks," Bertie says. "As well as that, the shark's prey, smaller species like smooth hound sharks, are being overfished.\par \par \uc2 "Protecting these predators helps protect entire ecosystems," Bertie insists. "They're indicators of ocean health. If you want healthy oceans - and we need them for food, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  regulation, even the air we breathe - you have to protect the species that maintain that balance."\par \par \uc2 But humans aren't the only threat, killer whales are known to hunt great white sharks. "They might seem friendly to humans, but they're not to anything else in the ocean. They're the true apex predators," Bertie says. "So although we think of great whites as untouchable predators, they're under pressure from all sides."\par \par \uc2 Despite these challenges, Bertie refuses to lose hope. "I don't believe in doom and gloom as a motivator," he says. "People already feel overwhelmed. Instead, I focus on hope and recovery. Nature is incredibly resilient. If we give it space and protection, it can bounce back."\par \par \uc2 That message of hope is seen in the film. "Some of our most incredible encounters were totally unexpected, like with southern right whales. These amazing whales were heavily targeted during the whaling era because they float after being killed," Bertie says. "But thanks to protections since the 1970s, they're making a comeback. The area where we filmed is a sanctuary for southern right whale mothers and calves. We had magical dives with them."\par \par \uc2 The documentary also embraces the unpredictability of nature. "Without giving too much away, this isn't your typical wildlife documentary. We celebrate the 'wins', but this film embraces failure, too," Bertie says. "Nature doesn't always deliver what you expect. But if you're passionate and persistent, it might give you something even better than you planned."\par \par \uc2 What Bertie is trying to shift is the narrative around sharks - especially great whites. "We've spent too long fearing great whites when we should be fearing for them," he says.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, they can be dangerous, but coexisting isn't about controlling sharks - it's about controlling human behaviour. When attacks happen, it's due to mistaken identity. Sharks don't want to eat humans - we're not fatty enough, like seals are, and we taste strange to them. But their hunting method involves striking hard and fast, so if they get it wrong, the consequences for a human can be catastrophic."\par \par \uc2 The solution, he says, lies not in culling but in changing human behaviour. "The key is reducing the chance of a mistake: don't swim at dawn or dusk, in murky water, or when you know a shark is nearby," he says.\par \par \uc2 But at the heart of Sharks Up Close is a deep belief in action and impact. "Yes, the planet's in trouble, but the work isn't hopeless," Bertie says. "If we stop trying to 'save the world' and instead fix one problem at a time - one coastline, one species - we'll see real results. That's what drives me."\par \par \uc2 Sharks Up Close with Bertie Gregory Tuesday, 8pm, Nat Geo Wild\par \par \uc2 human that maintain that balance."

"I want it to be a tool to strengthen the movement."\par \par \uc2 Her relationship with Hugo Loss, coordinator of Inspection Operations at Ibama (Brazilian Institute for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Renewable Natural Resources) and Yanuni's father, also gains strength in the narrative. "Our love, like our love for the Amazon, lived, not scripted, is something that Richard's lens has captured, and the audience feels it and reacts positively."\par \par \uc2 During the conversation, he shared what he learned at \uc2 MPI\uc2  and criticized the temporal framework and the dominant logic of the bioeconomy, as well as his concern that COP30 (the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  conference to be held in Bel\u233\'00\'E9m in November) is empty of the voices of the peoples of the Amazon.\par \par \uc2 In parallel to promoting the film, Juma has dedicated herself to strengthening the Juma Institute, which promotes environmental management and the valorization of traditional medicine in her territory. She has her mother, one of the first nursing technicians in the Middle Xingu, as a great inspiration, and with her she dreams and plans to promote a school of traditional knowledge.\par \par \uc2 How did you meet the director of "Yanuni" and how did you participate in the creation and production of the film? The first meeting with Richard was mediated by journalist Eliane Brum. She made the first contacts and helped me understand the importance of the project.\par \par \uc2 I'd already made accusations in documentaries, but I was exposed without support for my safety and I was already experiencing social isolation before the pandemic because of the assassination attempts. What Richard brought was different. He said: "I really want to do something for the Amazon. I feel responsible too. We're committed and we want to do it together with you".\par \par \uc2 My concern the whole time was to have other indigenous people in the movie, not just me. I think we succeeded. I feel happy.\par \par \uc2 What are your expectations regarding the impact of the film? I wanted people to connect personally with the film and to see that we often don't have the option of living peacefully in the territory. While I'm fighting, I'm failing to see my children grow up, to cultivate this relationship between mother, father, children, territory and knowledge, an exchange that I'm failing to pass on and also to receive. Something that could be much less of a burden for me and other leaders if society saw itself as co-responsible in the fight for \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  justice and social justice.\par \par \uc2 From the public's point of view, the film has taken on new meanings. Several people have said: "I had lost hope in humanity. I had lost hope in love. I want a Hugo [Loss, her husband] in my life. I want that love".\par \par \uc2 How are the Xipaia people and territory today? There is strong pressure from mining, drugs and other impacts and threats. We have strong religious interference, which is just as serious as mining. External violence also affects the territory.\par \par \uc2 In the not too distant past, there was a feeling that because we were in the heart of the Amazon, we were protected. That changed in April 2022, when my father came across a large dredger in our territory. They had money and technology we'd never seen before, and we realized that it's not that difficult to get there.\par \par \uc2 Since then, we've been on alert. We understood at that time that we needed to strengthen our territorial management.\par \par \uc2 We've managed to make progress on this, and this is one of the film's commitments to the territory, through the Juma Institute. And all decisions are taken with the participation of all the communities, leaders and environmental agents.\par \par \uc2 What were your main learnings at \uc2 MPI\uc2  and in the Bras\u237\'00\'EDlia \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ? The feeling I had was that the ministry is a territory of recent contact that we need to demarcate and remain in. I went to the ministry because I believe in Minister S\u244\'00\'F4nia Guajajara. But we're still in a space of resistance, even though we're inside the government, because the whole structure is still very Bolsonaro-oriented.\par \par \uc2 The experience was very important to get to know this reality, to understand the mechanisms and tools. This is a great opportunity for us to build public policies based on our experiences. This makes all the difference when thinking about policies for territorial management, for the protection and disintrusion of territories.\par \par \uc2 Being in Brasilia, inside a ministry, made me feel highly trapped, suffocated, with difficulty breathing. How do you get to a hearing and see that Z\u233\'00\'E9 Trov\u227\'00\'E3o [federal deputy for PL-SC], dealing with extremely hostile people who hate us?\par \par \uc2 We have few people like C\u233\'00\'E9lia Xakriab\u225\'00\'E1 [federal deputy for PSOL-MG], we have few people like S\u244\'00\'F4nia, we have few people like Jo\u234\'00\'EAnia Wapichana [president of Funai, the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples]. We need to go further. We need to be in government.\par \par \uc2 In the movie, there's a scene in which you're in a car, arriving in Brasilia for your work at the ministry, and you wonder if you're being too optimistic. Do you think you were being too optimistic? What is your assessment of the current government's policy on the rights of indigenous peoples? The feeling I had in the \uc2 MPI\uc2  was that there was a different fire every time. We didn't just have the Amazon on fire, we had Brazil on fire. When it wasn't on fire, it was dying from too much water.\par \par \uc2 We inherited a Brazil in collapse. From the previous government we received extremely malnourished children, girls and women who had been raped, countless acts of violence. \uc2 MPI\uc2 , FUNAI and \uc2 IBAMA\uc2  had to set up a huge task force to deal with a humanitarian crisis [of the Yanomami people].\par \par \uc2 It's important to understand that, as much as we have President Lula, the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, in this political \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  there are many anti-indigenous interests: it's not just mining, it's not just cattle, it's not just landowners, there are interests in real estate speculation, such as in the territory of the Patax\u243\'00\'F3s, in the south of Bahia.\par \par \uc2 In the face of all these challenges, I can see that there have been achievements. There has been progress in health, education and the national plan for the territorial management of indigenous peoples. But it's obvious that there's a lot of progress to be made. Brazil has many centuries of destruction, and we can't forget that.\par \par \uc2 The Federal Supreme Court recently held the last meeting of the Conciliation Commission, convened by Gilmar Mendes, on the time frame for demarcating indigenous territories. How do you see the current state of this debate? We shouldn't even be talking about the time frame, it shouldn't even be on the agenda, it's so absurd. Because there is no legal framework for us to be in Brazil. We were already here and we are still here.\par \par \uc2 This absurdity brings with it countless acts of violence that have not only happened, but are happening, and are being encouraged and financed to happen more. I remember the Patax\u243\'00\'F3s women, more than 300 leaders who were in Brasilia talking about the violence in their territories, the murders, the children who just wanted access to water?\par \par \uc2 In the film, your spiritual relationship with ancestry and the forest appears frequently. How can traditional medicine be strengthened? And how has the Juma Institute been working with this? Traditional medicine is my memory, it's my childhood. My mother was and still is my great inspiration. If I look at the collective today, it's because she taught me that.\par \par \uc2 She was the first nursing technician in the Middle Xingu. Always before giving an injection, a paracetamol, a dipyrone, she would make a tea, a bath, some blessings. She didn't just look after us, she looked after the village.\par \par \uc2 When I was a child, we had no hospital, no medication for malaria, no health care, no support from FUNAI. We only had the knowledge that was with the elders.\par \par \uc2 We want to pass on this knowledge to the next generations, to the children, to foster a school of forest knowledge. When the Kaarim\u227\'00\'E3 village opened, of which I am chief, we used to say: "Are we going to make our way back home? Let's go back to our origins?".\par \par \uc2 The bioeconomy has gained a lot of visibility in recent years as part of a positive agenda for the Amazon. How do you assess this concept and the public policies that have been developed? We've been trading and exchanging for a long time. If we really want a bioeconomy, we need to recognize those who have been doing this for centuries, without having to cut down a forest. Many have appropriated the term for biocapital, which is not my vision.\par \par \uc2 The bioeconomy can't be one where the non-indigenous are the entrepreneurs and the peoples only provide raw materials. There are communities with sustainable entrepreneurship, with mini-mills and processing of their products.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that there are countless incentives for those in the agro sector, for those who want to cut down trees, for those who want to plant fruit trees, exotic species, but few incentives for local development by the communities themselves, according to their needs and their vision of the bioeconomy.\par \par \uc2 At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, you asked us: what are we still not hearing? What would you say we're still not hearing today? I think there's too much haste, too much anxiety about doing, about immediacy. And little time to feel and see. I feel like this in a space, in a big crowd, with lots of people talking.\par \par \uc2 COP30 will be in the Amazon, but are the peoples of the Amazon really in this crowd? Are we still in this crowd, hearing many voices, but without ours actually being heard?\par \par \uc2 X-RAY | JUMA XIPAIA, 34 She was the first woman chief of the Middle Xingu, elected at the age of 24. An indigenous leader and environmental activist, she is the founder of the Juma Institute, created in 2020. She was Secretary of Articulation and Promotion of Indigenous Rights at the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples (MPI) and, in 2023, was inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Culture (ABC), in recognition of her struggle to defend the rights of indigenous peoples and protect the Amazon.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250705el75001yq\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Comment\par {\*\bkmkstart toc21}{\*\bkmkend toc21}\b \uc2 The 14 best science and tech documentaries of 2025 so far\b0\par\par\uc2 Bethan Ackerley \par \uc2 1,637 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2025\par \uc2 New Scientist News\par \uc2 NWSTN\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright New Scientist Ltd, All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 From David Attenborough to Hannah Fry via Bryan Johnson, our TV columnist Bethan Ackerley selects her favourite science and technology documentaries of the year to date\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.netflix.com/title/81757532"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Don\u8217\'20\'19t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever}}}\par \par \uc2 Netflix\par \par \uc2 Bryan Johnson is an unusual fellow by anyone\u8217\'20\'19s standards.

There are so many fascinating scenes in Tribe \u8211\'20\'13 from piranha fishing and political meetings to yag\u233\'00\'E9(ayahuasca) rituals \u8211\'20\'13 that you only wish we could spend more time observing.

Bad Influence follows child pageant star and dancer Piper Rockelle, who was allegedly exploited by her \u8220\'20\'1Cmomager\u8221\'20\'1D after rising to fame at age 9.

The follow-up season focuses on ADHD and dyslexia, two other highly misunderstood conditions. While the series largely focuses on the social challenges that can come with ADHD and dyslexia, there is good science to back things up, with some great insights into the neurological underpinnings of these conditions.

Future Publishing Ltd. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We run down our favourite film scenes that need to be heard in Dolby Atmos.\par \par \uc2 Dolby Atmos is becoming more and more common, both in and outside of the home.\par \par \uc2 Instead of only being able to fully immerse yourself with the technology in the cinema or with the most expensive kit money can buy, you can find it in many of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/home-cinema/best-soundbars"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 best soundbars}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/best-tv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 best TVs}}}\uc2 , and even the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/best-smartphones"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 best phones}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While the tech is more widespread, that does not mean it is always executed to the highest calibre. That means you need some tried and tested scenes to put your \uc2 Atmos\uc2  system through its paces.\par \par \uc2 But before we get into that, you may be wondering {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dolby-atmos-what-it-how-can-you-get-it"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 how does Dolby Atmos work}}}\uc2 ? The 3D surround-sound technology involves more than just shoving some speakers in your ceiling.\par \par \uc2 People often presume that \uc2 Atmos\uc2  is simply about placing sounds above your head, and that's certainly part of it. Really, though, \uc2 Atmos\uc2  is about using arrays of speakers in harmony to place effects in precise positions in a three-dimensional soundstage.\par \par \uc2 When done right Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  can deliver up to 118 simultaneous sound objects.\par \par \uc2 This immersive soundstage can be replicated by any kit with the capacity to decode it, ranging from home cinema systems to \uc2 Atmos\uc2 -enabled headphones.\par \par \uc2 Watching a film or TV show in \uc2 Atmos\uc2  can dramatically enhance your immersion and overall experience, in terms of both soundtrack and effects. In the hands of a great sound designer, it is a tool that provides the flexibility to build sonic landscapes that can transport, terrify and move you.\par \par \uc2 Below, you can find some of our favourite Dolby Atmos test scenes. These are scenes that we, the What Hi-Fi? review team, use when testing products, from soundbars to AV receivers, speaker packages to TVs.\par \par \uc2 A little disclaimer: because some of the best {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dolby-atmos-what-it-how-can-you-get-it"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dolby Atmos}}}\uc2  scenes appear quite late in their respective films, there may be some minor spoilers below.

Yes, please.\par \par \uc2 While director Ryan Coogler has found great success so far with big hitters such as Black Panther and Creed III, Sinners marks his first venture into directing an original story outside any franchise.\par \par \uc2 The film follows twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who have returned to the 1930s Jim Crow South to have a fresh start. When they open their own juke joint, though, they are followed by malevolent vampires.\par \par \uc2 There are so many scenes in Sinners that really put a Dolby Atmos device through its paces, but there\u8217\'20\'19s only one that sent shivers down my spine.\par \par \uc2 When the twins\u8217\'20\'19 cousin Sammy (portrayed by Miles Caton) discovers an ability to summon spirits from different generations, the supernatural creatures decide to join the party.\par \par \uc2 Past, present and future lives dance together in a beautiful mass, all surrounding Caton\u8217\'20\'19s character as he sings with his guitar.\par \par \uc2 Ludwig G\u246\'00\'F6ransson\u8217\'20\'19s soundtrack really helps to tie it together, too. As a frequent collaborator with Coogler on other films such as Black Panther, the two have absolutely nailed the marriage between a film\u8217\'20\'19s cinematography and music.\par \par \uc2 Caton\u8217\'20\'19s ethereal vocals soar over the varying styles of music as the camera swoops around the juke joint to show all the different spirits dancing in harmony.\par \par \uc2 Buy Sinners through {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sinners-Bonus-X-Ray-Ryan-Coogler/dp/B0DMY3CFX3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Amazon Prime Video}}}\uc2  or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/sinners/umc.cmc.tl0hc0j1vx7nrrz89gxzxsx9"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Apple TV}}}\par \par \uc2 Civil War \u8211\'20\'13 the battle for Washington, D.C.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDyQxtg0V2w"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Alex Garland\u8217\'20\'19s Civil War has become a firm fixture in our test rooms of late. It\u8217\'20\'19s great for testing TVs and projectors, thanks to its incredibly crisp, vibrant and contrasty picture, but it\u8217\'20\'19s also got an exceptional Dolby Atmos soundtrack that is great for testing audio equipment.\par \par \uc2 Our most-used section begins at the Western Forces Military Base in Charlottesville before proceeding to the climactic battle for Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 As the Western Forces prepare for the final push, there are the oppressive sounds of jets and helicopters flying overhead, and frenzied chatter from all directions, but then all of that hustle and bustle gives way to a beautiful piece of gentle guitar-playing that superbly juxtaposes the incendiary onscreen action as the battle commences.\par \par \uc2 That music ends as unexpectedly as it began, and with a huge explosion. From there, the action never relents, with tanks rolling over barricades and blasting pillboxes, choppers spewing minigun fire down city streets and mortars raining shells onto the grounds of the White House itself.\par \par \uc2 The general sounds of war will absolutely fill the room if your system is capable and correctly set up, and individual weapons should be precisely placed within the maelstrom. You should still be able to hear the snippets of dialogue, too.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Civil-War-Alex-Garland/dp/B0CW5LWN8W"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Civil War on Amazon Prime Video}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0D6486GVZ/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy the Civil War 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Warfare \u8211\'20\'13 Alpha Two\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JER0Fkyy3tw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 One presumes that Alex Garland\u8217\'20\'19s experience creating the Washington, D.C. battle for Civil War (above) with Navy SEAL veteran Ray Mendoza as military advisor is what inspired him to go on to create Warfare, which is essentially one long battle scene.\par \par \uc2 This is a smaller-scale battle, though, with Warfare telling the true story of a platoon of Navy SEALs (including Mendoza, who is credited here as writer and director alongside Garland) that comes under serious attack during a stakeout deep in the city of Ramadi, Iraq.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s an unusual movie, in that there\u8217\'20\'19s no backstory or character development to speak of, or even, really, a message. Instead, this is a more or less real-time retelling of one specific incident, designed to put you into the shoes of the soldiers and at the heart of the action.\par \par \uc2 Is it a good movie? Honestly, I\u8217\'20\'19m not entirely sure, but it is an interesting one.

Detailed little sound effects \u8211\'20\'13 crumbling plaster, dripping water, an electrical short and a high-pitched alarm \u8211\'20\'13 appear from all around you and together fill the room.

The hubbub throughout makes the city feel alive, but the superb dialogue is never anything other than crystal clear.\par \par \uc2 But the true strength of the upgraded audio presentation is its bass. The soundtrack is packed with sofa-shakingly epic hip-hop tracks by the likes of Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Cypress Hill, and gunshots are thrown out in thunderous style, particularly during the exhausting, action-packed finale.

If you have a Dolby Atmos system, it\u8217\'20\'19s also perhaps the most immersive as the outstanding sound design lets viewers dip in and out of the characters\u8217\'20\'19 perspectives, intensifying dramatic suspense and thrilling action while helping to keep them rapt for its three hour run time.\par \par \uc2 But it\u8217\'20\'19s not just Bruce Wayne\u8217\'20\'19s viewpoint we\u8217\'20\'19re treated to. In one of two uncannily realistic-sounding nightclub scenes, Zoe Kravitz\u8217\'20\'19s proto-Cat Woman stalks through the Iceberg Lounge and we\u8217\'20\'19re shown her sonic outlook as she passes by clubbers and leering men, while Batman's instructions, given remotely, are heard, voice-of-God style, in her ear.\par \par \uc2 At another point, we're even given a bat\u8217\'20\'19s-ear-view as Batman tries to retrieve a note from a captive Chiroptera, and we are placed firmly in its cage as distressed noises spin out above and around us in a deeply unsettling maelstrom.\par \par \uc2 Dolby Atmos is also frequently used to create breathing room within the dense soundscape, allowing the heavy, liturgical score (often pulled off the screen to the sides), rich tapestry of effects and hushed voices to co-exist without competing.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the car chase as Batman is pursuing the Penguin. The Batmobile rips through the middle of the soundfield while passing trucks, falling crates and sheeting rain bombard the viewer. But, the narrative of the sequence remains thrillingly clear, even with the persistently building music, guttural gunshots and spectacular sub-bass.

There's a spectacular palette of winds to enjoy, with close breezes in the grass used to both highlight and play against the expanse of the terrain, while the lack of privacy in the family home is implied by the gusts that rattle throughout its thin walls.\par \par \uc2 The characters in The Power Of The Dog are all in some way repressed and so signature sounds are used almost as leitmotifs to represent their emotions. The film opens with hyper-macho bully Phil striding across the ranch, and the sound of his weighty boots and ringing spurs indicate his strength and domineering presence.\par \par \uc2 The boots become an unconscious device to help convey to the audience his ability to torment others. In a wordless two-minute scene in which Rose is practising the piano so she might later impress her new husband's dinner guests, Phil begins playing along on his banjo, deliberately trying to put her off. It's an incredibly intense scene to watch even in stereo, but with a Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  system we are given Rose's perspective so we not only see how cruel Phil can be, but we feel it too.\par \par \uc2 Atmos\uc2  is used to locate Rose downstairs and the banjo in the rear corner of the roof. The mix pinpoints his location as he roams around, eventually expanding to fill the ceiling giving the audience the impression that his taunts are now occupying all of Rose\u8217\'20\'19s thoughts before the sound of his boots suddenly shocks Rose and brings the drama to a head.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100134077/type/dlg/sid/whathifi-gb-4118925048505796600/https://www.netflix.com/title/81127997"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Stream The Power Of The Dog in Dolby Atmos on Netflix}}}\par \par \uc2 No Time To Die \u8211\'20\'13 Chase Through Matera\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vw2FOYjCz38"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19re used to Bond films opening with a big set-piece, but No Time To Die switches things up, beginning instead with a flashback to Madeleine's childhood in Norway that\u8217\'20\'19s much more low-key and quietly terrifying. Mirroring the bleakness of the landscape, every sound is given acres of space, building intensity without overloading the viewer with layers of sound. The film\u8217\'20\'19s slow-burn start means that subsequently, the ambush at Vesper\u8217\'20\'19s tomb in Matera has an even greater impact.\par \par \uc2 The explosive sequence in the graveyard leads onto one of the film\u8217\'20\'19s standout sound design moments as Bond temporarily loses his hearing and the audience is given his sonic point of view. Instead of relying on a tinnitus ring, the designers filter out most of the sound, leaving just the low, vibrational elements of Bond\u8217\'20\'19s gasps and movements, disorientating the viewer. Even the score gets this treatment, and for the first time, Bond\u8217\'20\'19s vulnerability is alluded to before the crack of the bullet whizzes across the soundfield, and we\u8217\'20\'19re back in classic 007 territory.\par \par \uc2 In the spectacular chase through Matera that follows, there are plenty of wonderful details to be found, particularly if you get the opportunity to listen on a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/best-home-theatre-speaker-systems"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dolby Atmos system}}}\uc2 . After swinging off a bridge and flying into the air on a motorbike, it's a moment towards the end of this scene that we think yields the greatest sonic dividends.\par \par \uc2 The rain of bullets on the Aston Martin while Bond, thinking he\u8217\'20\'19s been betrayed, belligerently sits inside alongside Madeleine, is exquisitely rendered in 360 degrees from both an exterior and a cocooned interior perspective, interwoven with the vertiginous sound of the village's relentless churchbells. As the shots are fired, each concise crack and crunch varies, keeping the relentless onslaught dramatically interesting until the sound of crystals fragmenting hints to the audience that the car, like Bond, is not infallible.\par \par \uc2 The sound of No Time To Die supports the film\u8217\'20\'19s larger than life visuals and hits all the beats a well-versed audience demands but is still bursting with original, narrative sounds.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/no-time-to-die/umc.cmc.1sk81aco37s8f5grnjp6ydqad"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Rent or buy No Time to Die in Dolby Atmos from Apple}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-James-Ultra-Blu-ray-Region/dp/B09GQ5BRC3/ref=sr_1_3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy No Time To Die 4K Ultra HD from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Belfast \u8211\'20\'13 Opening Scene\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HcYh5Lfy1PI"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Based on the recollections of director Kenneth Branagh\u8217\'20\'19s childhood growing up in Northern Ireland, Belfast is told uncynically from the point of view of 10-year-old Buddy. Despite taking place against a backdrop of civil unrest and sectarian violence that would result in the largest forced mass movement of people since the Second World War, it's Buddy\u8217\'20\'19s own story that is front and centre. The Troubles sit on the periphery of the narrative and, consequently, the sound design.\par \par \uc2 The sound team aren't always literal with their soundscape, instead giving the audience subtle hints that what we are hearing is being interpreted through a child's ears. Voices of authority figures are pitched down to appear scarier, and unrealistic sound effects that Buddy would have only heard in films are sometimes used, such as the Western-style American freight train in the opening scene.\par \par \uc2 As Belfast doesn't have a traditional score, it opens up space for the filmmakers to be freer with featured sound effects and dialogue, weaving them together to form a rich, hyper-real tapestry that bubbles around Buddy. There's always a sense of something going on just out of shot that filters into Buddy's consciousness through his ears. Voices are frequently moving off centre while helicopters pepper the skies overhead, creating a soundscape that matches the story in being both epic and narrow. The general absence of music means that when it is used, it has all the impact of a massive great needle drop, providing many of the film's most joyful moments.\par \par \uc2 The film starts in spectacular sonic style, particularly if you get the opportunity to listen on a Dolby Atmos system, with a hectic summer afternoon of neighbours and children buzzing around the street. This scene will really highlight how well integrated your system is, with complex moving dialogue, every syllable of which should be audible.\par \par \uc2 As Buddy heads home he clocks a sound that seems familiar \u8211\'20\'13 a train. We soon realise something is amiss as the camera tracks around a bewildered Buddy and the noise of the train gradually evolves into something else. The swirling, slow-motion noises of the rioters start to meld with an expansive undulating low tone, fading down into Buddy's breath before anarchic violence bursts out from all sides, raining rocks overhead. Seamlessly the bin lid Buddy has just been playing with as a pretend knight becomes a real-life shield, used by his mother to protect him from his neighbours. The composed mixing of this scene, and indeed the entire film, keeps the chaos cohesive, helping the audience access both the narrative and Buddy's confusion without explicit explanation.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/belfast/umc.cmc.2jz7n19smc0g791llqpxa0f3h"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Stream Belfast (2021) in Dolby Atmos on Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Belfast-Blu-ray-Kenneth-Branagh/dp/B09PW431TZ/ref=sr_1_2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Belfast on Blu-ray at Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Dune \u8211\'20\'13 The Sandworm Reveal\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9xhJrPXop4"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Dune is that most rare of films \u8211\'20\'13 a subversive post-apocalyptic blockbuster entrenched in reality. To help ground its eccentric plot and surreal visuals, the sound design is used to construct a believable world full of desert landscapes and giant sandworms that the audience immediately feels a part of and protective toward. Of the 3200 custom sound effects created for the film, only four were totally synthesised. This means that rather than being faced with cold futurism found so often in sci-fi, Dune has a tactile familiarity.\par \par \uc2 The sound team have built the kingdom of Arrakis as a carefully sculpted sonic world, deeply rooted in authenticity, that delicately engulfs the audience creating a sense of intimacy as much as it does scale. In the scene about an hour into the film where we first encounter a giant sandworm, Paul and his father take a flight in an Ornithopter (a dragonfly-like aircraft) to inspect the spice harvest. The sound team manipulated organic insect and feline sounds to achieve the sound of a purring 'plane' flying high above the desert. As things start to go awry with the worm's arrival, Dolby Atmos is used expertly to create the stunning sensation of the craft dive-bombing deep into the sand storm.\par \par \uc2 What follows is an incredible, all-encompassing sonic cocktail of moaning desert winds, tinkling granular dust, colossal monsters and glitching ethereal voices that flow in succession across a dynamic range that stuns. There\u8217\'20\'19s very little dialogue, but the storytelling is clear, compelling, and beautifully capped off by a moment of stillness as the rattling aircraft and beleaguered crew return to base.\par \par \uc2 Hans Zimmer\u8217\'20\'19s magnificent genre-bending score is used to add even more layers of texture and emotional punch and is pulled around the space in a way that integrates, rather than dominates, the rest of the audio. There\u8217\'20\'19s a continual, seamless handing-over between the FX and music that unifies the soundfield and enhances the drama without overwhelming the viewer. It\u8217\'20\'19s often said that awards for best sound go to films with the most sound rather than the best sound, but with its 2022 Oscar for Achievement in Sound, we think Dune proves that it\u8217\'20\'19s possible to have both.\par \par \uc2 Dune can be streamed in Dolby Atmos at home from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/hbo-max-roku-fire-tv-stick-free-trial-and-how-to-watch-from-abroad-all-explained"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 HBO Max}}}\uc2 .

From a soda can missile that whips overhead crackling with lethal transients to whizzing drones, to a raining army of kamikaze Furbies, the sound design is incredible, maintaining coherence amongst the chaos and perfectly preserving the sparkling script's insightful humour.\par \par \uc2 There's also a wonderful dynamic range at play; the gradual crescendo from the first lone killer Furby's laugh quietly reverberating up above to the supersized Godzilla Furby's climactic entrance is an exemplary display of building excitement and anticipation through sound.\par \par \uc2 This offering from \uc2 Sony Pictures\uc2 , which missed out on its full theatrical release, went straight to \uc2 Netflix\uc2 , where it truly warrants a viewing in Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/the-best-dolby-vision-movies-to-test-your-tv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dolby Vision}}}\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81399614"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch The Mitchells vs. the Machines in Dolby Atmos on Netflix}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mitchells-vs-Machines-Blu-ray/dp/B09JZSW8K4/ref=sr_1_3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy The Mitchells vs the Machines on Blu-ray at Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Nobody \u8211\'20\'13 The Final Showdown\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZti8QKBWPo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Born of the John Wick playbook (this and all three of the John Wick films were written by Derek Kolstad), Nobody actually turns out to be far more enjoyable than its progenitor thanks to a wittier script, a more seemingly pathetic main character and, most of all, Bob Odenkirk \u8211\'20\'13 an inspired and surprising choice who convinces both as a man on the cusp of death by suburban boredom and one capable of ripping someone\u8217\'20\'19s throat out with his bare hands.\par \par \uc2 This is a brutal, gory affair with superbly choreographed fight scenes that have an unusually bruising realism to them, not to mention a healthy dose of very dark humour.\par \par \uc2 The sound is strong throughout and the music is great, but it\u8217\'20\'19s the epic final showdown that will give your sound system the most enjoyable workout. Beginning at around 72mins with a crunching car chase soundtracked by Pat Benatar\u8217\'20\'19s brilliant Heartbreaker, this scene eventually turns into an 18-rated version of the Home Alone break-in scene, with the family home replaced by a warehouse and the paint cans by claymores.

So badly is this future war going, that a global draft is quickly implemented, and that\u8217\'20\'19s how charming science teacher Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) ends up being sent forward in time to shoot aliens in the face neck and stomach.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s lots of impressive Atmos action throughout the film, but the scene in which Dan and his even greener civilian squad mates are sent forward in time is arguably the best. Beginning at the 32:25 mark with a quiet, backstory-filling chat between our main man and the equally lovable Charlie (played by Veep\u8217\'20\'19s Sam Richardson), chaos quickly ensues as a siren blares to announce the squad\u8217\'20\'19s early deployment.\par \par \uc2 As the civvies-turned-soldiers line up in a hangar, the portal to the future fills the ceiling above and fills the space above your head with roaring audio \u8211\'20\'13 assuming your system is doing its job correctly. There\u8217\'20\'19s a huge amount of drama and intensity to this build-up that those listening through basic speakers simply won\u8217\'20\'19t experience, and the time jump itself is an AV roller coaster with a spectacularly shocking climax.

In this scene, as K and Joi fly out of Los Angeles towards the orphanage, the soundscape transitions from loud \u8211\'20\'13 the waves crashing against the flood barrier \u8211\'20\'13 to eerily quiet as the rain hits the windshield wipers, with occasional bits of clearly projected dialogue.\par \par \uc2 While the storm batters the car, low, distant rumbles of thunder become a more constant barrage from the sky. The bullets fired from below streak across the room, and the music builds again, with more menace this time. Suddenly, a spark of lightning plunges everything into near silence as all power is lost, and all that is left is the sound of the rain. These sonic contrasts make for a serious challenge \u8211\'20\'13 every dynamic shift needs to be handled confidently so that every dramatic point is delivered.\par \par \uc2 Reinforcing those loud effects is the Hans Zimmer-composed, Vangelis-like soundtrack with its sonorous, undulating bass. As with the first Blade Runner film, 2049 notably embeds sound into the score, blurring the lines between effects and music to create a unified sonic landscape full of tonality, motion and texture. In fact, it\u8217\'20\'19s the music that gets the most Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  treatment; using the surrounds for big, intense moments prevents the image from ever narrowing, with both image and audio maintaining an epic scope.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/blade-runner-2049/id1287369934"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Blade Runner 2049 in Dolby Atmos via iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VFN6WLH/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Blade Runner 2049 on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Gravity \u8211\'20\'13 Drifting in Space\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiTiKOy59o4"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Throughout the tense 90 minutes of Gravity, which sees \uc2 Sandra Bullock\uc2  hurtling through the vacuum of space with only the memory of George Clooney for company, the Oscar-winning Dolby Atmos mix (available only on the limited edition Diamond Luxe Blu-ray or the special edition HD Blu-ray) helps the viewer find focus within the confusing geography of nothingness while also heightening the sensation of disorientation.\par \par \uc2 In a film where becoming untethered is a constant threat, the sound team decided to set the dialogue free from the centre of the screen and allowed it to track with the actors. So in the opening scene, as Bullock tumbles, we hear Clooney\u8217\'20\'19s radio communication follow her terrifying trajectory. The placement of the voices is brilliantly precise and convincing, but it\u8217\'20\'19s not just the voices that have been allowed to float; the entire score is composed for \uc2 Atmos\uc2 , moving, swelling and clashing with the action.\par \par \uc2 With little ambience to play with, the surrounds are used effectively to show changes of space within\u8230\'20\'26 well, space. While Bullock starts drifting, the camera zooms right inside her helmet, and sonically we join that space for the first time \u8211\'20\'13 the air, breath and hint of tinnitus subtly cloaking us. More dynamic is the fire scene later in the film that burns overhead until the airlock is shut, damping everything down before more deep thuds from above. There\u8217\'20\'19s plenty for your vertical channels to grapple with here.\par \par \uc2 Finding a disc version of Gravity with the Dolby Atmos soundtrack isn't as easy as you might think. There's the rare (and expensive) Diamond Luxe Edition and the more affordable 2015 Special Edition, which sadly is only in 1080p. A 4K Blu-ray re-release is said to be forthcoming, and you've got to hope that will include the film's ground-breaking \uc2 Atmos\uc2  soundtrack.

Unlike the other films on this list, there\u8217\'20\'19s no score in Roma, which frees up the rest of the soundtrack to be dense and bold while remaining sincere and specific.\par \par \uc2 In Roma, the fluidity of \uc2 Atmos\uc2  aligns with Alfonso Cuar\u243\'00\'F3n\u8217\'20\'19s photography concept \u8211\'20\'13 slow long takes \u8211\'20\'13 to give the audience a window into a particular space, and to access the characters and story in a frank and potent way. As the camera pans, the detailed soundscape \u8211\'20\'13 birds, dogs, hail, street vendors and even dialogue \u8211\'20\'13 joins in the change in perspective, drawing the viewer into the frame and producing an eloquent but voyeuristic sense of movement throughout Mexico City in 1970/71.\par \par \uc2 The film's emotional climax comes as maid Cleodegaria Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez wades into the sea to save her employer's children, despite not knowing how to swim.

Just how many cats did Freddie Mercury really own? Would Queen always resolve every conflict by writing a hit single? Has Brian May only ever have one haircut?\par \par \uc2 However, the final 20 minutes of the film that recreates, almost in full, Queen\u8217\'20\'19s legendary Live Aid performance at Wembley is exquisitely captivating and the closest feeling to being at a live gig we\u8217\'20\'19ve had in quite some time.\par \par \uc2 The film's audio team went to great lengths to have sonic options that matched every camera angle of this marathon scene. Along with the 16-track archive recording secretly made by the BBC at the time, they were able to capture PA ambience with the help of Queen\u8217\'20\'19s sound engineers, who played back the film tracks in an empty stadium kitted out with 22 mics before a gig.\par \par \uc2 The result of this attention to detail, combined with Dolby Atmos\u8217\'20\'19 location placement, means that whether the camera is behind the strings of Freddie's piano, in amongst Roger Taylor's kit, or jostling in the press pit, the audio perspective has astonishing realism.\par \par \uc2 The scene opens with a camera flying over the raucous stadium crowd and a swooping sensation of height and movement. As we move around the stage, we hear the proximity of each amp and instrument, and within the crowd, we are surrounded by thousands of chanting voices. Even the long shots from the cheap seats should feel engulfing, transportive and irresistibly enjoyable, particularly as the crowd gradually begins to sing along to the first verse of We Are The Champions, building to an almighty choral roar that's almost impossible not to get swept away in.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/bohemian-rhapsody/id1438698362"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Bohemian Rhapsody in Dolby Atmos via iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bohemian-Rhapsody-Blu-ray-Rami-Malek/dp/B07JH242WL/ref=tmm_frk_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1621250291&sr=1-3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Bohemian Rhapsody on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 A Quiet Place \u8211\'20\'13 Giving Birth\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-vWzOx-BiA"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 You'd be forgiven for thinking a film about the importance of silence might not have much to keep your \uc2 Atmos\uc2  system interested. In actual fact, the sound effects in A Quiet Place are unexpectedly compelling, making full use of the capabilities of object-based mixing to create a terrifying 3D soundscape.\par \par \uc2 This film is an expert display of carefully controlled suspense, and the dynamic range of the effects is a huge contributing factor as the pervading silence heightens each bare footstep and every rustle in the cornfield or creak of a floorboard.\par \par \uc2 And it's not just delicate sounds that have an impact. In the scene in which Emily Blunt's character attempts to give birth in total silence, she seeks safety in the basement. The thuds of the alien thrashing around above are captured with ominous weight in the overheads. As the creature descends the stairs and stalks around, its proximity and movements are palpable. Your ears prick with every breath, so much so that when fireworks are finally set off as a distraction, the thunderous explosion releases the tension, for a brief moment at least.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/a-quiet-place/id1356850151"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch A Quiet Place in Dolby Atmos via iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07C5MGM5T/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy A Quiet Place on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 1917 \u8211\'20\'13 Desperate Sprint\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DX1NHfGf9Cc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 In 1917 Sam Mendes achieved what may well be the zenith of single-take-style cinema. The film tracks the journey of two young British privates tasked to deliver a message across no-mans-land in order to prevent another battalion from going over the top and falling into a German trap. The cinematography cleverly and subtly engages with the viewer, who acutely shares in the real-time unfolding of the landscape, perils and futility of the soldiers' odyssey.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Atmos\uc2  soundtrack mirrors the camerawork creating a sense of first-person realism without being literal. By inhabiting the same perspective, the sounds of the landscape are revealed to the audience as they are being revealed to the soldiers. This means that unknown threats such as the distant planes in the barn scene remain atmospheric until they come sharply into focus as we slowly realise a dogfight is going on overhead and one crashes to the ground. The prolonged intensity is made possible by the sonic respites after every loud scene, softening the soundtrack to keep the audience engaged.\par \par \uc2 Toward the end of the film, as Private Schofield doggedly attempts to call off the attack, he sprints across the top of a trench while soldiers charge across his path. The layers of sound around him are brutal, terrifyingly located and, given the context, not gratuitously used. Shell explosions, gunfire and raining debris are heard from all directions as Schofield powers on; but it's not just a cacophony \u8211\'20\'13 there's an authentic sense of personal toil and proximity that heightens the drama and danger.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082YPWNHG/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy 1917 on 4K Blu Ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Baby Driver \u8211\'20\'13 The Getaway\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ARFyrM6gVs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Baby Driver is the story of a getaway driver, Baby, who suffers from chronic tinnitus.

We first hear a growing high pitched ring that morphs into a sustained string note that shifts seamlessly into the breaking sound of a car. Then Baby hits play on his iPod, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://open.spotify.com/album/6n6VzpTcnHFpGVwJhLNkoH?highlight=spotify:track:6NJQpFNkDCMaRBogIi9sOI"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bellbottoms}}}\uc2  by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion starts to play. It's a song with serious attack that bursts to life from the entire system, giving you a sense of being in a private sonic bubble.\par \par \uc2 The sound often works in tempo with the music, highlighting syncopated beats. The constant movement and organic realism of these effects prevent the sound design conceit from ever feeling gimmicky or clumsy. As the getaway begins and the tyres screech across the soundscape, the car slides about while the sonic integration between the fronts and rears is tight and seamless.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in the soundtrack, \uc2 Atmos\uc2  is frequently used to meld effects and score together and create a unified accompaniment that's almost like a traditional musical. In the warehouse scene after the Tequila shoot-out, there are low-key sonic components that continue to reverberate after each small sound effect \u8211\'20\'13 a light switch, a stool creaking, a bag dropping \u8211\'20\'13 decaying into the rears and adding an underlying tension to an uneasy quiet moment.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/baby-driver/id1239575681"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Baby Driver in Dolby Atmos via iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073FFSV4Z"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Baby Driver on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Unbroken \u8211\'20\'13 Bombing Run\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrwStyGB3jE"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Angelina Jolie's Unbroken is an early example of the power of Dolby Atmos as well as brilliant sound design. It's glorious from the off, opening with a reverberant choral score that slowly gives way to the hum of an approaching squadron of bombers, with each propeller given an individual dimension as the rotor blades buzz past.\par \par \uc2 Atmos\uc2  is about more than just height; the extra axis of sound means the designer can place effects into the soundfield and add to the overheads. This scene has both as the Japanese planes swoop, followed closely by rattling machine gun fire spiralling after them.\par \par \uc2 There's a real sense of contrast in size and exposure inside the aircraft as we switch between locations. Despite the roar of the wind and the mechanics of the plane, sounds such as the gunner's chair, the creaking of an old leather jacket and radio dialogue are all detailed and brought in and out of focus as the dog fight unfolds.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00LY1YNRK"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Unbroken on Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 The Sound Of Metal \u8211\'20\'13 Final Scene\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HlPyRcIMWM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 The Sound Of Metal captures the pain of a musician, Ruben, who is losing his hearing and searching desperately for treatment. While it may not have extravagant soundscapes in the traditional sense, it uses Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  to immerse the audience into a non-hearing world, exploring the realm between sound and vibration.\par \par \uc2 If that weren't ambitious enough, after Ruben gets cochlear implants, the filmmakers reintroduce sound to create a new digital, distorted world. The sound team created 20-30 layers of \uc2 Atmos\uc2  from the location recordings on set and separated the soundscape into components \u8211\'20\'13 harmonics, noises and transients \u8211\'20\'13 before recombining it to create \u8216\'20\'18Frankenstein sound\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 As cochlear implants do not give a sense of location, the soundscape is modulated to disorientate the viewer. Directionality becomes warped to match how the brain would perceive them. The disorientating synthetic sounds aren't easy to listen to, but rather than alienate the viewer, it draws us in, creating a powerful finale.\par \par \uc2 While The Sound of Metal is available to stream (including in 4K as part of an \uc2 Amazon\uc2  Prime subscription), it seems that the Dolby Atmos soundtrack is exclusive to the Blu-ray.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B091ZPRGV1/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy The Sound Of Metal on Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Soul \u8211\'20\'13 The Great Before vs New York\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBh-Y2SiOtc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 The latest in a long line of \uc2 Disney\uc2  animated features to tackle the family-friendly subject matter of death, Soul centres on middle-aged jazz musician Joe, who is still waiting for his big break while he teaches elementary school. After a golden opportunity arises, Joe meets an untimely end but manages to get waylaid in \u8216\'20\'18the great before\u8217\'20\'19, where souls are made before they come to Earth. There he meets '22', a soul without a purpose who isn't keen on becoming human.\par \par \uc2 Dolby Atmos is used to build two diverse, realistic and otherworldly environments with liberal use of all the available channels creating an enthralling sonic experience. In \u8216\'20\'18the great before\u8217\'20\'19, the rears and overheads are filled with springy reverb and a large, enveloping soundscape. The soft atmospherics remain intentional and precise, melded together with Trent Reznor\u8217\'20\'19s delicate electronic score.\par \par \uc2 The animation style is abstract, and many of the characters don\u8217\'20\'19t have clear faces to help convey dialogue, but even a bohemian shaman (voiced by Graham Norton) crisscrossing the echoing astral plane in a pirate ship sounds clear, precise and natural.\par \par \uc2 In contrast with the ethereal eccentricity of the great before, Soul\u8217\'20\'19s autumnal New York is incredibly tactile, bustling and full of life. There's a great surge of sound when Joe and '22' first leave the hospital that sweeps over the viewer and doesn\u8217\'20\'19t let up. The cacophony of New York as experienced for the first time is overwhelming, from the guttural pile driver and passing firetrucks to the thronging crowds and helicopter overhead.\par \par \uc2 On Earth, Jon Batiste takes over scoring duties, and the jazz accompaniment is beautifully layered and lush, bounding along with the buzz of the city. The authenticity of each space that Joe plays in - from a small club to the school classroom to his empty apartment post-show - is incredibly well-realised, transportative and at times devastating.\par \par \uc2 Soul might have skipped a cinematic release and headed straight to the small screen, but it\u8217\'20\'19s well worthy of a proper Dolby \uc2 Atmos\uc2  set-up to do justice to its well-crafted, split personality soundtrack.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://disney.co.uk/movies/soul"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Soul in Dolby Atmos on Disney+}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08V335Y6Y/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Soul on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Mad Max: Fury Road \u8211\'20\'13 The Hunt\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtjGTrVwRr4"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Another post-apocalyptic follow-up set 30 years after its predecessor, Mad Max: Fury Road acts as both a sequel and a reboot of the series. Tom Hardy steps into the role of former cop Max Rockatansky, adrift in a world that's been engulfed by the desert and haunted by the memories of those he's failed to save.\par \par \uc2 Visually Fury Road is relentless, and while you certainly wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t call the soundtrack subtle, it is incredibly focused and stunningly layered, directing the viewer\u8217\'20\'19s attention within the often dense picture while maintaining an epic sense of scale.\par \par \uc2 From gunshots echoing through the desert wasteland and sandstorms tearing overhead, to Max\u8217\'20\'19s internal headspace (and his close mic\u8217\'20\'19d often mumbled dialogue), this two-hour chase opera boasts impressive dynamism and some exceptional moments of sonic respite.\par \par \uc2 However, the pace never lets up, and this clip at the start of the hunt shows how \uc2 Atmos\uc2  can help ground even the most outlandish of scenarios. As the cars and their unique engine sounds steer across the soundfield, they're accompanied by Junkie XL\u8217\'20\'19s furious orchestral soundtrack.\par \par \uc2 Distorted guitar riffs suddenly flare up whenever the camera cuts to the Doof Warrior and his double-necked, flame-shooting guitar. Angry drums egg the chase on while the strings and electronic beats are carefully woven into the action.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/mad-max-4-fury-road/id990549112"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Mad Max: Fury Road in Dolby Atmos on iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01CQT9RFQ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy Mad Max: Fury Road on 4K Blu-ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 mother! \u8211\'20\'13 The Final Third\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcBlM3VLePM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 In Darren Aronofsky\u8217\'20\'19s mother! Jennifer Lawrence plays \u8216\'20\'18mother\u8217\'20\'19, who lives with her poet husband, \u8216\'20\'18him\u8217\'20\'19 (Javier Bardem), in a secluded, creepy house that is besieged by a series of uninvited guests.\par \par \uc2 But this isn't just a simple home invasion horror, mother! is also a parable about \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, a meditation on fame and an interpretation of the Bible. Most importantly, though, it has an ingenious Dolby Atmos soundtrack (courtesy of Requiem for Dream's Craig Henighan) that does all the heavy lifting.\par \par \uc2 Apart from the opening and closing scenes, everything is filmed subjectively from mother\u8217\'20\'19s perspective, either over the shoulder, in close-up or POV and the only long shots are when she\u8217\'20\'19s alone. To bring us even closer to the central character\u8217\'20\'19s experience, the film reflects the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  that mother hears. Everything, not just what is shown on screen, is given a defined position that is always slightly elevated.\par \par \uc2 The house's presence as a character is intensified through seemingly innocuous sounds such as creaks and rattling pipes manipulated to become more human-sounding. As the invasion progresses into a fever dream, the small sonic exaggerations increase and become overwhelming in number and intensity.\par \par \uc2 But even with chaos erupting and people swarming the house, dialogue and actions remain detailed, clear and precisely placed, fading in and out of mother's focus. The latter third of the film builds into a sustained bedlam with some tremendous low-end effects to test your subwoofer.\par \par \uc2 It's certainly not for everyone, but if you can withstand the weirdness, mother! shows just how adaptable and avant-garde Atmos can be.\par \par \uc2 While you can watch mother! for free via an \uc2 Amazon\uc2  Prime subscription, you'll only hear the 5.1 version of the soundtrack if you do so.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/mother/id1273360788"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch mother! in Dolby Atmos via iTunes / Apple TV}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075B3KLS3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Buy mother! on Blu ray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 Uncut Gems \u8211\'20\'13 Opening Scene\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/embed/TmlVK6fG1gg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Uncut Gems follows Howard (played by Adam Sandler), a jeweller in New York\u8217\'20\'19s frantically paced Diamond District, as he attempts to auction off a rare Ethiopian opal for a massive return.\par \par \uc2 The film starts with Howard getting a colonoscopy, and we quickly realise that\u8217\'20\'19s a minor discomfort within the grand scheme of his life. He is maintaining a fake marriage to his wife while hiding his girlfriend from his children, and he\u8217\'20\'19s $100,000 in debt to a particularly nasty loan shark. Selling the opal is his escape plan, but unfortunately, the rock catches the eye of basketball player Kevin Garnett who wants to borrow it as a good look charm for his next match, offering his valuable championship ring as collateral. Howard can\u8217\'20\'19t refuse, and this begins a chain of bad decisions, each more infuriating than the last.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s never stated, but Howard is addicted to gambling. As he continues to fall from one debt-laced predicament to another, each time using the source of his problems as the solution, there is a sense of a modern Greek Tragedy playing out.\par \par \uc2 Throughout, the sound design walks a fine line between unwatchably overwhelming and grippingly immersive. There\u8217\'20\'19s an element of an unseen Greek Chorus in the meditative vocalisations of the expansive synth-heavy score. The opening sequence begins outside an Ethiopian quarry where a miner has just been severely injured, but the external melee switches to two lone pit workers deep in the reverberant bowels of the mine. The score then bursts out and off the screen, drawing us into the scene before segueing ingeniously into Howard\u8217\'20\'19s world.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s no question that Uncut Gems is claustrophobic to watch and listen to. Still, the Dolby Atmos sound design helps to convey the general confusion and constant danger of Howard\u8217\'20\'19s chaotic lifestyle, tightly enveloping the viewer in his world until they slowly start to root for this Willy Loman styled anti-hero.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80990663?s=i&trkid=13747225&vlang=en&clip=81156151"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Uncut Gems in Dolby Atmos on Netflix}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.com/Uncut-Gems-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B09F5J3PK4/ref=tmm_frk_swatch_0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Watch Uncut Gems on Bluray from Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 MORE\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/the-best-dolby-vision-movies-to-test-your-tv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The best Dolby Vision movies to test your TV}}}\par \par \uc2 Check out our list of the best {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/us/best-buys/best-dolby-atmos-soundbars-the-best-atmos-tv-speakers"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dolby Atmos soundbars}}}\uc2  you can buy\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/11-best-4k-blu-rays-to-test-your-system"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 16 of the best 4K Blu-rays to test your system}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/10-of-the-best-film-scores-to-test-your-system"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 10 of the best movie scores to test your system}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/best-tv-shows-to-watch-on-netflix-uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whathifi.com/features/the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-on-amazon-prime-video-uk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 22 of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFmGvbjcchvf5Jgpz5bVmk.webp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A movie still from Warfare showing army soldiers holding guns (A24)}}}\par \par \uc2 Document HIFIW00020250704el740008e\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Human Interest\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Knaresborough filmmakers win acclaim in USA for new 'short' which offers real hope on  \highlight22\uc2 climate \highlight\uc2  change\b0\par\par\uc2 Graham Chalmers (graham.chalmers@nationalworld.com) \par \uc2 390 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2025\par \uc2 The Harrogate Advertiser\par \uc2 HARADV\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 National World Publishing Ltd.

You know, it was a bit too harsh for the public,\u8221\'20\'1D Kizilkaya told The Times. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ve been going out with trawlers for so long. But seeing that damage \u8230\'20\'26 before your eyes is a totally different thing.

The footage was filmed in Turkish waters at an undisclosed location. The team did not know the seagrass was there until they retrieved the footage, as it was 27 metres underwater.\par \par \uc2 Kizilkaya said the Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) would take a long time to recover because it grew slowly, at about 2cm a year. The damage to the habitat is bad news for fish, which use it as a nursery for their young, and for tackling \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CScientific papers have proven that it\u8217\'20\'19s the plant on the planet having the highest capacity of carbon storage, which is about eight kilograms per square meter, ten times higher than rainforests,\u8221\'20\'1D Kizilkaya said.\par \par \uc2 Sophie Benbow, marine director at \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  group \uc2 Fauna & Flora\uc2 , who saw the footage in Nice, said: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a lose-lose-lose for wildlife, the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  and for all of us who rely on a healthy ocean for our survival.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Kizilkaya said the public could play a key role in stopping bottom trawling by asking fishmongers and restaurants about where they sourced their fish and seafood. \u8220\'20\'1CIn a month, we can stop the whole bottom trawling industry. It\u8217\'20\'19s all about the end consumer,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 UK government\uc2  is consulting on the ban on bottom trawling in 41 of the country\u8217\'20\'19s 377 MPAs, but is facing a fierce pushback from fishing trade bodies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis ban will cause huge hardship to fishermen and their families and it will advance the cause of marine \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  no more than a far more targeted restriction would do,\u8221\'20\'1D the National Federation of Fishermen\u8217\'20\'19s Organisations claimed in a blogpost. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an astonishing attack on fishermen and coastal communities.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Seagrass species can be found in UK waters and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.thetimes.com/uk/environment/article/restoring-britains-seagrass-meadows-net-zero-clean-it-up-s3m9gfgl0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 several \b  \highlight22conservation\b0 \highlight22  efforts are under way to restore meadows}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document TIMEUK0020250702el72003jv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

There were even storyboards made during the production of the Spielberg classic, but the scene was dropped because of technical limitations.\par \par \uc2 "This was 1992, and making a T. rex, period, was going to be this enormous challenge," Koepp recalls.

When brainstorming, one of the first things they talked about was finally revisiting the raft scene. "That was like being able to scratch something that has itched for 32 years," Koepp says, and adds it was "worth the wait" for computer-generated imagery to get good enough to do the sequence justice.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/28/USAT/84399914007-jurassic.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The raft sequence from "Jurassic World Rebirth" comes straight from Michael Crichton's original "Jurassic Park" novel.}}}\par \par \uc2 This wasn't the only instance of scrapped "Jurassic" material being revived in "Rebirth."

Koepp, drawing on Crichton's novel, had Dr. Ian Malcolm ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/08/29/netflix-kaos-jeff-goldbum-wicked-interview/74977142007/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jeff Goldblum}}}\uc2 ) utter that line in an early draft of "Jurassic Park" and has wanted to find a place for it ever since.\par \par \uc2 "I remember asking Steven ... did that line ever show up?"

It's going in here."\par \par \uc2 'Jurassic World Rebirth' aims to make dinosaurs 'special again'\par \par \uc2 The raft scene may not have fit in, had "Rebirth" not gone back to "Jurassic" basics by returning to the island setting.\par \par \uc2 While 2022's "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/06/08/jurassic-world-dominion-movie-review/7535848001/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jurassic World Dominion}}}\uc2 " ended with dinosaurs and humans coexisting around the world, "Rebirth" effectively resets to the status quo of the first "Jurassic" trilogy by revealing the Earth's \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  has made it impossible for dinosaurs to survive outside of a few tropical islands.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/28/USAT/84399931007-2583-d-010-01066-r-1200-x-8005-b-2-df-79.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jonathan Bailey's Dr. Henry Loomis delivers dialogue in "Jurassic World Rebirth" that was originally written for Jeff Goldblum in the original "Jurassic Park."}}}\par \par \uc2 Koepp wanted to make dinosaurs "special again and harder to find" and bring back the "ocean and jungle adventure aspect" of the series. The idea of dinosaurs interacting with humans on the mainland had been explored thoroughly enough in previous films, he felt \u8722\'22\'12 including his own "The Lost World," which ended with a T. rex loose in San Diego.\par \par \uc2 The plot point was also once again inspired by the original novel, in which Ian points out how different the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is today compared to 65 million years ago during his famous "life finds a way" speech.\par \par \uc2 That's not the only reason it's a tough time to be a dinosaur in "Rebirth," which establishes the public has largely lost interest in the creatures. Edwards and Koepp both saw this as a meta reflection of the issue facing "Jurassic" itself, six sequels in.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest problem is, there's been a lot of 'Jurassic' films," Edwards says. "What can you do that people haven't seen before? The script acknowledged that problem on page 1. I thought it was very honest and a really good way to reset and start a new chapter."\par \par \uc2 This article originally appeared on \uc2 USA TODAY\uc2 : 'Jurassic World Rebirth' brings back iconic scene that Spielberg cut\par \par \uc2 Document USATONL020250702el72000uq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw127\pich40\picscaley313\picscalex313\picwgoal610\pichgoal192

It\u8217\'20\'19s all a construction.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ever since Louis Lumi\u232\'00\'E8re filmed workers leaving his factory in 1895, documentary film has struggled with the idea of authenticity. Lumi\u232\'00\'E8re\u8217\'20\'19s 17-metre film is regarded as the first ever made yet even this modest document is a lie: it was filmed not on a work day but a Sunday. The ethnographer Robert Flaherty staged scenes in his 1922 documentary Nanook of the North, and it was Michael Moore\u8217\'20\'19s crafty editing that made Roger and Me an emotive box office hit.\par \par \uc2 Brady\u8217\'20\'19s 2018 breakthrough film Island of the Hungry Ghosts, and her latest, The Wolves Always Come at Night, invite audiences, festival programmers, critics, funding bodies and peers to contend with what is, for many, still a new format: the hybrid documentary. <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goInp93kzF8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goInp93kzF8}}}\uc2 " > </figure>\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI only use that word, hybrid, to signify an in-between space,\u8221\'20\'1D Brady says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt doesn\u8217\'20\'19t tell you how it was made. It just lets you know that it\u8217\'20\'19s not entirely documentary, or that the film-maker may have used some fictional tools, which most documentaries have.\u8221\'20\'1D <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">\par \par \uc2 Related: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/island-hungry-ghosts-review-australia-guantanamo-gabrielle-brady"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Island of the Hungry Ghosts review \u8211\'20\'13 grim view of Australia\u8217\'20\'19s Guant\u225\'00\'E1namo}}}\uc2  </aside>\par \par \uc2 To create her films, Brady works with the subjects to tell their story. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/13/island-of-the-hungry-ghosts-review-timely-documentary-australia-asylum-camp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Island of the Hungry Ghosts}}}\uc2  was shot on Christmas Island where Brady entwined spiritual ceremonies; the millennia-old migration cycle of the island\u8217\'20\'19s famous crabs; and the daily life of Poh Lin Lee, a counsellor working with asylum seekers being held in indefinite detention.

For Brady, this was just one of many ethical complexities the project demanded.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COrdinarily, protagonists don\u8217\'20\'19t get any creative input,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CIf they\u8217\'20\'19re not being paid and if it\u8217\'20\'19s just their story for the sake of everyone else, that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t seem a fair exchange. I like to think of people you\u8217\'20\'19re working with more as team members, creative collaborators. I\u8217\'20\'19m really big on people getting paid. Not for their story or to say a certain thing but for their time.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Brady\u8217\'20\'19s new film, The Wolves Always Come at Night, follows a young couple, Davaa and Zaya, and their four children, living in the steppes of Mongolia. We get to know them through their connection with their animals and knowledge of the land, lovingly rendered by Brady in bright, dynamic and warmly intimate scenes. After a devastating dust storm, the family are forced to give up their livelihoods and move to the outskirts of the city, a sprawling shantytown known as the ger district.\par \par \uc2 Many of the film\u8217\'20\'19s biggest themes \u8211\'20\'13 \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, displacement, economic precarity, the end of a millennia-deep connection to land and animals \u8211\'20\'13 haunt the most powerful scenes but go unspoken. Naturalistic conversations take place between the family, scenes that feel inseparable from the story around them. In one particularly intimate moment, Davaa and Zaya lie in bed and contemplate their future. Davaa begins to cry before Zaya quietly scolds him, \u8220\'20\'1CDon\u8217\'20\'19t cry in bed.\u8221\'20\'1D As Brady explains, moments like this were created collaboratively with the cast and crew.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor that scene, Davaa and I discussed how the audience can understand the grief he is carrying. I had witnessed that a few times, the burden that he carried; the way he would discuss it was incredibly potent and just laden with this weight. I\u8217\'20\'19d had this idea: what if you were to meet an older herder in the ger district and have this conversation? He said, \u8216\'20\'18That would never happen. It has to be with Zaya and the kids can\u8217\'20\'19t be there. It has to be dark, and it has to be quiet. This is [the only way] I would go to those places,\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CThen we created that \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  with no expectation of what would unfold.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Brady\u8217\'20\'19s connection to Mongolia began when she was a teenager. Growing up in the New South Wales Blue Mountains west of Sydney, she studied theatre media in Bathurst with aspirations of becoming an actor. After working as a producer on Sunrise and The Morning Show, Brady joined a volunteer program and spent a year in Mongolia where she produced and co-hosted a children\u8217\'20\'19s television program, Voice Box, designed to help people learn English. Mentioning the show brings forth a burst of laughter. \u8220\'20\'1COh my God, it was so wonderfully cheesy. We\u8217\'20\'19d travel around, interview kids \u8211\'20\'13 like the school chess champion \u8211\'20\'13 and live with nomadic families. A lot of what was shown on TV then was imported from Russia or China, so the idea was to make something that was English, learning about Mongolian kids. Everything was handmade. It really looked like a 70s Australian TV set.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Once back in Australia, Brady chased that feeling to Yuendumu, a remote community in the Northern Territory, where she helped other film-makers make their films. It was there she realised she wanted to become a director.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe longer I stayed in Australia, the more I was being pushed to become a producer,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut I wanted to be a director, and [as a woman] it was very hard to see myself as one \u8230\'20\'26 I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t being held back, I [just] didn\u8217\'20\'19t feel there was any opportunity. A lot of my favourite films were from Europe and South America, and I wanted to learn a different way of seeing the world, so I went and studied film in Cuba.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In Cuba, Brady studied at Escuela Internacional de Cine y Televisi\u243\'00\'F3n, a regional film-making school with no internet connection, where students are banned from using a camera for the first year of their three-year course. There, in a state of culture shock, Brady began again. \u8220\'20\'1CI burned everything I knew to the ground,\u8221\'20\'1D she says, \u8220\'20\'1Cand rebuilt a vision for how I wanted to make films.\u8221\'20\'1D To graduate, she had to travel around the country, interviewing locals and collecting their stories.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe study itself blurred the lines between documentary and fiction,\u8221\'20\'1D Brady says \u8211\'20\'13 a practice she took into her own films. \u8220\'20\'1CBoth Ghosts and Wolves asked for this way of storytelling \u8211\'20\'13 to not create suffering for people to be inside of what they\u8217\'20\'19re going through but instead create a bit of distance. I\u8217\'20\'19m authoring the vision; they\u8217\'20\'19re authoring their story.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The seed for the story of her latest film was planted five years ago. On her return visits to Mongolia to see friends, Brady found that some had been forced to leave the countryside and move to the city. When she mentioned this to her friend, the producer Ariunaa Tserenpil, Tserenpil said it was the sort of story local film-makers would never tell.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn Mongolia, we are so connected to nature and our animals but we are not looking into each other because we are shy,\u8221\'20\'1D Tserenpil says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe feel more comfortable with nature and we don\u8217\'20\'19t talk about our grief. Outside of the city, each family lives a very long distance from each other, and we do not have a sense of community because nomads are very independent people. But Gab put these people at the centre. This intimacy is very beautiful.\u8221\'20\'1D <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">\par \par \uc2 Related: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/07/the-golden-spurtle-review-a-cosy-celebration-of-porridge-and-its-champions"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Golden Spurtle review \u8211\'20\'13 a cosy celebration of porridge and its champions}}}\uc2  </aside>\par \par \uc2 Brady was \u8220\'20\'1Ctentative and hesitant\u8221\'20\'1D about telling the story. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a long legacy of foreign film-makers coming in and making a certain type of film in Mongolia particularly. But the idea grew on me,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re seeing two polarities. In one extreme, there\u8217\'20\'19s this really extractionist way of film-making that\u8217\'20\'19s very exploitative. But on the other side you end up saying, \u8216\'20\'18Can you only make a film from the town you\u8217\'20\'19re in?\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18Can you only make a film about a woman if you\u8217\'20\'19re a woman?\u8217\'20\'19 So, no. Let\u8217\'20\'19s make something in between. An insider-outsider film and see if we can find a new dialogue in that way of storytelling as well.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While Brady\u8217\'20\'19s work has earned widespread acclaim, it remains an anomaly in the documentary world. When she began making films in the 2010s, the ecosystem was at its critical and commercial zenith, with lauded film-makers including Laura Poitras, \uc2 Alex Gibney\uc2  and Errol Morris. Around the end of the decade came the rise of the streaming services and an insatiable demand for cheaply made nonfiction storytelling: formulaic true-crime expos\u233\'00\'E9s, sports films and celebrity profiles made with the approval of their participants. Documentaries that reach cinemas and awards circuits often centre on urgent modern catastrophes \u8211\'20\'13 the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the war in Gaza. Both trends make Brady\u8217\'20\'19s work even more unusual.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe documentary world is topical by nature, and those are the films that might get awards,\u8221\'20\'1D says Brady. \u8220\'20\'1CI see documentaries as much an art form as fiction, but I don\u8217\'20\'19t think other people do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 The Wolves Always Come at Night is in Australian cinemas from 3 July.

For cinephiles who cite it as one of the greatest pieces of modern cinema, it was about moral corruption, fractured masculinity, and a new frontier in the sheer magnitude of what film could convey. However, as Steven Spielberg\u8217\'20\'19s masterpiece turns 50, for many, its legacy remains inexorably tied to the 25-foot great white at its centre, as illustrated in a new National Geographic documentary tied to the anniversary, Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story. The film features interviews with Spielberg himself and a roster of Hollywood legends, including James Cameron, Jordan Peele, George Lucas, Guillermo del Toro, JJ Abrams, Emily Blunt and Steven Soderbergh, talking about how Jaws shaped their creative lives. There\u8217\'20\'19s also a roster of shark scientists explaining how, despite the initial scares it invoked, Jaws wound up doing more good than harm for sharks. But we\u8217\'20\'19ll get to that.\par \par \uc2 First, a recap of the plot. Based on Peter Benchley\u8217\'20\'19s bestselling novel of the same name, Jaws tells the story of a deadly shark that viciously rips its way through a fictional US seaside town, Amity Island, and follows the locals\u8217\'20\'19 attempts to find and kill it. But this wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just your average predator. This shark had a human thirst for vengeance, specifically going after those who\u8217\'20\'19d tried to harm it.\par \par \uc2 To say that the film had a lasting impression on the perception of sharks would be a gross understatement. Following its release in 1975, the number of large sharks along the eastern seaboard of North America fell drastically after thousands of fishers set out to catch trophy sharks in some sort of strange bid to assert their masculinity. Research published in 2021 found that since the 1970s, the populations of the world\u8217\'20\'19s sharks and their close relatives, rays, have declined by more than 70 per cent. Meanwhile, according to a report released at the end of 2024 by the \uc2 International Union for \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Nature\uc2 , one-third of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction.\par \par \uc2 Obviously, Jaws is not solely responsible for this \u8211\'20\'13 overfishing, the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis and habitat destruction are all partially to blame \u8211\'20\'13 but the film plays a significant part in the threat that humans pose to sharks by sheer dint of their perception. And yet, this perception is wildly misguided. Millions of swimmers and surfers go into the seas and oceans every year and yet the average number of shark bites recorded annually is just 64 \u8211\'20\'13 and just 9 per cent of those are fatal, according to the International Shark Attack File, the world\u8217\'20\'19s only scientifically documented, comprehensive database of all known shark attacks. That amounts to roughly six humans killed by a shark each year, while humans are estimated to kill up to 100 million sharks in that time, according to the \uc2 International Fund for Animal Welfare\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnybody who was around the water knew to be careful if they were swimming, but Jaws just jumpstarted that fear,\u8221\'20\'1D says Wendy Benchley, who, alongside her late husband and Jaws author Peter, dedicated most of her life to shark \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  after the film came out. \u8220\'20\'1CWe were horrified that people took it as a licence to kill sharks,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 The damage is such that even Spielberg himself has voiced regrets. \u8220\'20\'1CI truly and to this day regret the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film,\u8221\'20\'1D he said on an episode of BBC Radio Four\u8217\'20\'19s Desert Island Discs in 2022, adding that he now has his own fears. \u8220\'20\'1CNot to get eaten by a shark, but that sharks are somehow mad at me for the feeding frenzy of crazy sports fishermen that happened after 1975.\u8221\'20\'1D Benchley, who passed away in 2006, said similarly in 2000: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat I now know, which wasn't known when I wrote Jaws, is that there is no such thing as a rogue shark that develops a taste for human flesh.\u8221\'20\'1D Indeed, sharks generally have no interest in us at all. Only about a dozen of the more than 300 species have been involved in attacks on humans.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLack of education and misinformation often leads to bad outcomes,\u8221\'20\'1D says Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the state\u8217\'20\'19s Museum of Natural History. \u8220\'20\'1CIn the case of the \u8216\'20\'18sharks as man-eater myth\u8217\'20\'19, it has caused many people to fear these animals and miss out on learning about one of the most mysterious and fascinating groups of vertebrates on the planet. Just to put things in context, the origin of sharks predates all mammals, all dinosaurs, and all flowering plants... That alone should give people pause.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Naylor points out that sharks have been around for 400 million years, which is about 200 times as long as humans. While humans have always swum in the sea, and the development of seaside resorts in the Victorian era boosted the pastime, sea-swimming saw its biggest surge in the 1980s, thanks to the widespread popularity of recreational water sports, like snorkelling, surfing and kite surfing. The result? \u8220\'20\'1CHumans sharing coastal marine habitats with sharks is a very, very recent thing in the scheme of life on earth,\u8221\'20\'1D explains Naylor. \u8220\'20\'1CSharks view human presence in their \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  as an anomaly, not a food source.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s not to say there haven\u8217\'20\'19t been gruesome real-life incidents to incite fear. Consider the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in the Second World War. It was July 1945 and the ship, which had delivered parts of the first atomic bomb to the Tinian Naval Base, was sailing towards the Philippines when it was struck by Japanese torpedoes. Within 12 minutes, the 610-foot ship had sunk, leaving around 900 men drifting in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where hundreds of sharks soon descended. Some fed on dead bodies, others targeted the living.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe were losing three or four each night and day,\u8221\'20\'1D said Loel Dean Cox, who was 19 at the time, in an interview with the BBC. \u8220\'20\'1CYou were constantly in fear because you'd see \u8217\'20\'19em all the time. Every few minutes, you\u8217\'20\'19d see their fins \u8211\'20\'13 a dozen to two dozen fins in the water.\u8221\'20\'1D Despite common misconceptions about the sinking, though, sharks weren\u8217\'20\'19t the predominant reason people died. It was mostly dehydration, sun exposure, and days spent without food and water while the men waited to be rescued. Out of a crew of nearly 1,200, just 317 survived. Estimates as to how many of them died from shark attacks range from a dozen to 150.\par \par \uc2 Sharks view human presence in their \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  as an anomaly, not a food source\par \par \uc2 Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the state\u8217\'20\'19s Museum of Natural History\par \par \uc2 The attack is referenced in Jaws \u8211\'20\'13 shark hunter Quint, played by Robert Shaw, tells a harrowing story about his own experience in the water, revealing himself as a survivor. Naturally, his account paints sharks as the primary villains. It\u8217\'20\'19s a direct contrast to Benchley\u8217\'20\'19s own experiences \u8211\'20\'13 Wendy tells me that during their filmmaking days, sharks were so wildly uninterested in coming near them in the water that they had to bait them with prey so they\u8217\'20\'19d come close enough to capture on camera.\par \par \uc2 For their 40th wedding anniversary, the couple went cage diving with female great whites off Guadalupe Island in Mexico. \u8220\'20\'1CThat was magnificent,\u8221\'20\'1D she recalls. \u8220\'20\'1CWe would have three or four big female great whites just cruising past the cage like grey torpedoes and I could put my hand out and stroke them slightly from head to tail. They don\u8217\'20\'19t wiggle a lot when they swim. That was a thrill. It was an exciting life to be able to do that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For Laurent Bouzereau, who directed the National Geographic documentary, Jaws was never really about sharks at all. \u8220\'20\'1CI hadn\u8217\'20\'19t thought about the impact the film had on sharks until I made this film,\u8221\'20\'1D he confesses. It was only after meeting the Benchley family, all of whom feature in the documentary, and speaking to the litany of shark and ocean experts, that his perception shifted. \u8220\'20\'1COne of the reasons Steven wanted to do this film was to talk about this and how it was a completely unintended consequence of the movie. Because in his mind and my mind, you know, the shark is a metaphor. I never looked at it and worried, is this realistic? Could this happen?\u8221\'20\'1D The thing that elicited people\u8217\'20\'19s fears, argues Bouzereau, wasn\u8217\'20\'19t the shark itself; it was the fear of the unknown. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd the fear of being vulnerable in the ocean and not knowing what\u8217\'20\'19s underneath,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds. \u8220\'20\'1CThe shark became symbolic of that feeling that we all identify with. So sharks unintentionally became the bad guy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The documentary examines how, despite that initial knee-jerk reaction from shark hunters, Jaws had a hugely positive impact on shark \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  long term. \u8220\'20\'1CThe applications to study marine science shot up after Jaws,\u8221\'20\'1D says Wendy. \u8220\'20\'1CPeter also received thousands of letters from people saying they wanted to learn more about sharks and be just like Hooper,\u8221\'20\'1D she adds, referring to the character played by Richard Dreyfuss, who worked as a marine scientist. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s thrilling for me to have this out because not only does it show the magic of Steven\u8217\'20\'19s movie, but it goes into the positive effects of Jaws.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Some facts to illustrate the incredulity of sharks as a species: they are apex predators and, as a result, are crucial to maintaining the health of marine ecosystems. They can get up to 30,000 teeth in a lifetime, given that they never stop generating them. They can hugely vary in size, with whale sharks stretching to around 12 metres long. And, perhaps most fascinatingly, they have a sixth sense thanks to a specialised sensory organ on their snouts, the ampullae of Lorenzini, that helps them sense electric fields emitted by nearby prey. Tragically, their fins are a delicacy in Asia, which is one of the reasons many are caught and killed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a real love for sharks now,\u8221\'20\'1D chimes Bouzereau. \u8220\'20\'1CYou see people saving ones on \uc2 Instagram\uc2  that have been beached. Things have changed and people understand that the ocean is their territory. If I go to the jungle, I\u8217\'20\'19m not going to be walking around embracing lions. It\u8217\'20\'19s the same thing with the ocean, so sharks are getting a much better name and I was thrilled to be able to include that angle in the film. I don\u8217\'20\'19t think any other movie has had that kind of U-turn impact.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As soon as you start reading about sharks, it doesn't take long to realise how much respect these creatures deserve. Majestic, intelligent and largely unthreatening to humans, there\u8217\'20\'19s no better time than now to replace fiction with fact and see them for what they are: fascinating animals we should do everything to protect.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story\u8217\'20\'19 premieres on Friday 11 July at 8pm on National Geographic and streams the same day on \uc2 Disney\uc2 +\par \par \uc2 Document INDOP00020250701el7100001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw137\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2055\pichgoal600

It also handled a deeper issue of a tight-knit community juggling these cats, an invasive species, alongside the preservation of their spirituality and traditions.\par \par \uc2 On March 28, the Reservoir Center for Water Solutions showcased three short films for the festival: \u8220\'20\'1CThe Little Brown Bird\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1CProtecting Local Waterways,\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 a collection of two short films.\par \par \uc2 Courtesy of DCEFF Website\par \par \uc2 Clip from The Cats of Gokogu Shrine Trailer\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Little Brown Bird,\u8221\'20\'1D directed by KT Bryden, is about the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow, one of many birds at risk of extinction in the U.S. The film follows biologist Fabiola Baeza-Tarin and a team dedicated to protecting the sparrows and their habitat in the Everglades.\par \par \uc2 More from The Eagle\par \par \uc2 New Metrobus routes started Sunday.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 About 15 years ago, Libby Lenkinski was one of the activists who traveled every weekend to the West Bank village of Bil'in to join protests against the construction of the separation barrier on village land. As an American-Israeli, she took on the role of translating the events for an international audience\u8211\'20\'13explaining to foreign diplomats and media what was happening during these demonstrations and the forces at play in the conflict.\par \par \uc2 Then, she came across {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2013-07-27/ty-article/.premium/west-bankers-take-to-the-hills-in-fence-fight/0000017f-e7c6-da9b-a1ff-efefa8f00000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the documentary "Budrus" (2009)}}}\uc2 , which chronicled the struggle of another West Bank village against the same barrier. She found in the film a powerful partner in advocacy \u8211\'20\'13 one that was professional, emotionally resonant, and incredibly effective at conveying complex realities.\par \par \uc2 "Suddenly I realized this documentary was doing a better job than I was at explaining the situation," she says. "They needed a little help with the film's PR, so I stepped in. But at the same time, the film helped me \u8211\'20\'13 because not many people were willing to come to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-11-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-palestinian-village-where-the-intifada-never-ended/0000017f-e4e8-d804-ad7f-f5fad7910000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bil'in}}}\uc2 , but they were willing to watch a film about a similar struggle in another village and then engage in conversation with a few activists. That they agreed to."\par \par \uc2 At the time, Lenkinski was also working with \uc2 Yesh Din\uc2 , an Israeli human rights NGO focused on documenting violations of Palestinian rights in the West Bank. The group had just released a report on the military court system. She quickly discovered how difficult it was to communicate the contents of such a report to international diplomats. Fortunately, Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's 2011 documentary, "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/2011-11-18/ty-article/the-truth-but-not-the-whole-truth/0000017f-e0ff-d804-ad7f-f1ff2b0a0000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Law in These Parts}}}\uc2 " \u8211\'20\'13 was released just in time to help.\par \par \uc2 "Back then, the international understanding of the occupation was limited mostly to scenes of violence or abuse at checkpoints, there was no in-depth understanding of the system behind it," she explains, "That made the report very hard to use for advocacy purposes. Then I found out Ra'anan was making a film on the topic. He showed me a rough cut, and once again I realized: I could help them, but really, the film helped me. Because after people watched it, no one needed me to explain anything anymore."\par \par \uc2 Today, 15 years later, Lenkinski heads Albi, a relatively new independent American foundation that supports film and TV projects either created by or focused on Israelis and Palestinians. According to its website, the foundation is "entirely committed to equality and democracy," offering support for projects "at every phase and in any genre \u8211\'20\'13 so long as the perspective is clear and the potential for impact is strong."\par \par \uc2 The official launching of Albi was planned for March 2020, but then COVID-19 happened, and the plan was canceled. The foundation began as a low-key operation until it was officially launched last year.\par \par \uc2 For over a decade, Lenkinski has served as the Vice President for Public Engagement at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-10/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/dont-tell-me-im-not-jewish-enough-for-not-believing-in-a-dictatorship/00000186-c81f-dc44-abe6-cdbfe4cc0000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New Israel Fund}}}\uc2 . Despite this role, she emphasizes that Albi is an independent entity with its own separate budget. The decision to establish Albi stemmed from a growing understanding that art and culture \u8211\'20\'13 especially film and television \u8211\'20\'13 can serve as powerful arenas for social and political change. As she puts it: "Lectures about policy interest some people, but many more care about these issues without being drawn to that format."\par \par \uc2 Challenging the Hegemony\par \par \uc2 Although Albi plans to expand into other artistic disciplines in the future, it currently supports films and TV series that address a wide range of subjects.\par \par \uc2 A representative sampling of its supported projects includes: "Indal," A series about police racism and violence faced by Israel's Ethiopian community; "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2024-06-16/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-ex-yeshiva-boy-turned-drag-queen-behind-new-yorks-god-optional-shul/00000190-20fe-df6a-a3f6-2ffeb97b0000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sabbath Queen}}}\uc2 ," a documentary following a member of an Orthodox rabbinic family who begins performing as a drag queen; and "Of Dogs and Men" by Dani Rosenberg, a film about a girl who returns to her kibbutz to search for her dog, lost during the October 7 attack.\par \par \uc2 Other projects include "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/2019-02-21/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-underground-american-israeli-street-artist-coming-out-of-the-dark/0000017f-f65c-d318-afff-f77fdedd0000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Know Hope}}}\uc2 " by Omer Shamir, the winner of the most recent DocAviv Festival, documenting Israeli street artist Addam Yekutieli (aka Know Hope) as he navigates chronic illness alongside his political-artistic work; "Coexistence, My Ass!," a documentary about stand-up comedian and activist Noam Shuster-Eliassi as she attempts to pursue her career in an increasingly divided Israel; And "Yes!," the latest film by Nadav Lapid, about an Israeli musician who, after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-04-18/ty-article-static/.premium/what-happened-on-oct-7/0000018e-c1b7-dc93-adce-eff753020000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 October 7}}}\uc2 , sells his soul and art to the devil in order to write a new national anthem for Israel.\par \par \uc2 "Sabbath Queen," which follows a member of an Orthodox rabbinic family who performs as a drag queen.\par \par \uc2 "We set ourselves a goal of challenging the hegemonic narrative with every choice," says Lenkinski. While some of the films Albi supports address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not all do. Unlike traditional film foundations, artistic merit is not the sole criterion for selection.\par \par \uc2 "I founded Albi for social and political impact \u8211\'20\'13 not just for art's sake," Lenkinski explains. "That said, I believe that artistic excellence is the key to conveying a political message effectively. So our first criterion is that the film must be genuinely good. I and the Albi board must believe in its artistic merit, because only then can it break through into the dominant discourse."\par \par \uc2 Still, among the films you've supported, there are several that deal with the conflict\u8211\'20\'13including some that dared to give space to the Palestinian narrative and, as a result, faced harassment and censorship from right-wing activists. Do you have an interest in investing in such projects, in backing them?\par \par \uc2 "The answer is yes," Lenkinski responds. "But the fact that a film is targeted doesn't automatically qualify it for Albi's support.

Through the Albi Institute, which operates alongside the funding arm and supports broader cultural organizations and initiatives, they've begun building a protection system for those targeted by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-03/ty-article/.premium/following-threats-by-right-wing-activists-youth-movement-cancels-no-other-land-screening/00000195-fa5f-d855-a7bf-fadf5bed0000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 right-wing harassment}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We have to take action to ensure that Israel remains an open space for creativity \u8211\'20\'13 that's foundational to any democracy.

"You see it, for example, in the Rabinovich Foundation's requirement that artists sign loyalty declarations in order to receive support. We know that even now, foundation heads must push back hard to maintain their independence in project selection."\par \par \uc2 She adds that the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  is already fostering self-censorship.

So having an independent funding source for critical art in Israel, one that can resist this pressure, has been my guiding vision for years."\par \par \uc2 "Of Dogs and Men," about a girl who returns to her kibbutz to search for her dog, lost during the October 7 attack.\par \par \uc2 A strategy of opposition\par \par \uc2 In a landscape where film and television creators in Israel are heavily reliant on public film foundations and public or commercial broadcasters, Albi stands out as an appealing alternative \u8211\'20\'13 one free from political pressures and commercial interests. It sounds like a dream solution, yet dreams often clash with the harsh realities of the current \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Albi's main challenge is its limited budget \u8211\'20\'13 just $1.5 million annually. By comparison, the combined annual budget of Israel's two leading film foundations for feature films alone was, until recently, around 50 million shekels (approximately $15 million), before the implementation of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-12/ty-article/.premium/and-the-big-winner-of-israels-cinema-reform-a-west-bank-film-fund/00000194-f9b2-db1f-a5dd-f9b3b3830000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Culture Minister Miki Zohar's cinema reform}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At present, Albi is funded by private foundations and individual donors. These are people, Lenkinski explains, "who care about social change in Israel-Palestine, and I have to convince them that culture is another way to achieve that goal." Some advised her not to proceed unless she could raise $10 million, warning her, "you can't do anything in film without $10 million." Still, she went for it.\par \par \uc2 "I wish Albi were big enough to be a significant funding source for film productions, and I hope we'll get there someday. But even now, the very fact that we offer an independent source of funding is, in itself, a strategy of opposition to the shrinking space for critical voices."\par \par \uc2 "Yes!" by Nadav Lapid. Albi\u8217\'20\'19s modest grant still enabled the team to return to work on the script after October 7.\par \par \uc2 Currently, Albi's grants for each production range from $10,000 to $18,000. Though relatively small sums, they come with a significant advantage: flexibility. Public film foundations often operate under strict regulations. Funding is tied to rigid schedules, specific production phases, and other bureaucratic conditions. At Albi, the approach is far more agile.\par \par \uc2 "The funds we provide can be used at any stage of a project and for any purpose," she says, and this flexibility creates "interesting situations."\par \par \uc2 She offers specific examples: Albi's grant to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.haaretz.com/life/2025-05-31/ty-article-magazine/.premium/new-film-captures-the-cognitive-dissonance-defining-israeli-identity-since-october-7/00000197-07b4-d3df-addf-9fbf43860000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Nadav Lapid's film}}}\uc2 , while tiny in proportion to the film's overall budget, enabled the team to return to work on the script after October 7.

However, few holidaymakers realise that there is actually a perfect alternative right here in Europe, which saves the 10-hour flight and jet lag.\par \par \uc2 data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"\par \par \uc2 Dubbed "Little Havanna," this thriving city on Spain's southern coast boasts narrow streets and architecture that reflects the Cuban capital. Although much older than the Caribbean island, founded around 1,100 BC, the social, cultural, and architectural \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  of this Andalusian city is comparable to that of Cuba. Plus, with water on three sides, the city almost looks like an island.\par \par \uc2 The old town of Cadiz features narrow, winding streets and squares that resemble those found in Havana's historic centre.\par \par \uc2 The seaside city of C\u225\'00\'E1diz is the capital of the province of the same name, located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, right next to the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 The old town of Cadiz features narrow, winding streets and squares that resemble those found in Havana's historic centre. Its pastel-coloured buildings and wrought-iron balconies add to the charm. For those looking to really get into the Cuban vibe, Habana Cafe is the place to go, which, according to one visitor, boasts "The best Caipirinha you can find outside Brazil. Just go there, enjoy the Latin music."\par \par \uc2 In fact, C\u225\'00\'E1diz is so closely tied to Cuba that film directors have been known to choose the Spanish city as a set location to simulate Cuba. For example, a famous scene in the James Bond movie "Die Another Day" involving Halle Berry was filmed on Cadiz's La Caleta beach. Meanwhile, the entire 1979 movie, Cuba, featuring Sean Connery, was filmed in Cadiz.\par \par \uc2 The city boasts a continually warm \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , rarely dropping below 16C even in winter, and around 300 days of sunshine a year, reminiscent of that on a tropical island.\par \par \uc2 The city is dotted with parks where exotic plants flourish, including giant trees supposedly brought from the New World.\par \par \uc2 The 1,476ft sandy beach of La Caleta, lined with restaurants and bars, remains the city's most popular and is celebrated by both tourists and locals.\par \par \uc2 C\u225\'00\'E1diz's Old Town, which retains remnants of its city walls, is characterised by its various quarters are available for as little as \u163\'00\'A384 in early July with \uc2 TUI\uc2  one way. For even cheaper, you can also fly into Seville from Gatwick with Vueling for just \u163\'00\'A341 and then head to Cadiz for a day trip via a one-hour 24-minute train.\par \par \uc2 Document EXCO000020250629el6t005eu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

The latter took advantage of his intervention to launch a very direct suggestion to the former US president."\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  should see this movie," \uc2 Forbes\uc2  declared, alluding to the fact that the Vietnam case dismantles many myths about the effects of globalization and free trade that the White House is taking for granted with its protectionist rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 In fact, during the presentation, \uc2 Forbes\uc2  recalled that Trump went so far as to threaten Vietnam with tariffs of 46?% in the midst of a trade war, while the Asian country's response was to offer a reciprocal tariff of 0?%. "Why didn't Trump accept?" wondered Forbes, a regular critic of protectionism and staunch advocate of free trade.\par \par \uc2 Documentary on the Doi Moi reforms The documentary tells an economic story that has gone unnoticed in many media, but which represents a true silent revolution: that of a communist country that, without renouncing its socialist rhetoric, has embraced the principles of capitalism to get out of misery. In the early 1990s, 80% of the Vietnamese population lived below the poverty line. Today that figure is down to 3%. Back then, annual GDP per capita was a mere $98, even lower than in chaotic nations such as Somalia or Sierra Leone. In contrast, Vietnam is now one of the most dynamic economies in Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 The key to this transformation was the economic reform program initiated in the late 1980s under the name of ??i M?i (a term that could be translated as "renewal"), which allowed the introduction of private property rights, the liberalization of key sectors and the opening up to foreign investment. As Zitelmann demonstrates in his work, no country of comparable size has climbed as high on the Index of Economic Freedom as Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 The documentary not only analyzes data, but puts a face to this change through several personal stories. Among them is that of Kao Seu Luc, founder of the country's most successful bakery chain. Born in Cambodia, Luc narrowly escaped the genocide of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970's. "I was on the list of those to be executed. I arrived in Vietnam with no money, no contacts and without speaking the language," the entrepreneur recounts in the documentary. Today, Luc is an entrepreneurial reference in the region.\par \par \uc2 The production also includes the testimony of figures such as Xuan Phuong, a leading manufacturer of incense sticks, and Nguyen Quoc Thong, another successful entrepreneur. Both underline the deep respect that exists in Vietnam for entrepreneurs and the wealthy, a cultural attitude that contrasts with the growing \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  of social envy in many Western nations. In fact, the documentary itself includes surveys confirming that the rate of social envy in Vietnam is significantly lower than in much of Europe.\par \par \uc2 One of the most striking aspects of the documentary is the way in which the Vietnamese do not blame other countries for their problems, despite having suffered devastating wars with the United States, China, Japan or France over the last century. Instead, the citizens of the Asian country have sought the causes of their misery in their own structures and decisions, demonstrating an unusual maturity. Today, according to polls and interviews collected in the documentary, the United States enjoys a very positive image among the Vietnamese population, despite the war that marked both nations in the second half of the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 The full documentary can be seen in the following video, with subtitles available in ten languages:\par \par \uc2 Four key lessons for other countries The central message of the documentary can be summarized in four lessons that Zitelmann considers fundamental for developing countries: (1) "the only real way out of poverty is not international development aid, but more capitalism", (2) "foreign investment, free trade and globalization are not enemies of poor countries, but powerful allies", (3) "when entrepreneurs and the rich are seen as role models, not scapegoats, it creates a social \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  conducive to economic growth" and (4) "at both the national and individual level, blaming others for one's own problems impedes progress. We thrive only when we take responsibility and ownership of our lives and seek solutions on our own".\par \par \uc2 Zitelmann makes no secret that capitalist reforms have increased inequality in Vietnam, but notes that "most Vietnamese do not see this as a major problem. Their priority is not to achieve artificial equality, but to get out of poverty and improve their standard of living." Also, "although the country remains a one-party dictatorship with little freedom of expression, its economic model is increasingly moving away from traditional socialism, which facilitates an eventual transition".\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250628el6s003ky\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw302\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4530\pichgoal600

BW Business World (India) \par \par \uc2 Zohran Kwame Mamdani was born on 18 October 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, into a household where intellect and artistic vision intertwined with political sensibility. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a widely respected scholar whose work on African politics and postcolonial theory has earned international recognition. His mother, Mira Nair, is an acclaimed filmmaker whose cinematic voice has championed stories of cultural hybridity, displacement, and social justice. It\u8217\'20\'19s no surprise, then, that Zohran would grow up attuned not just to the pulse of ideas, but to the emotional resonance behind them - a trait that would later find its political expression in New York\u8217\'20\'19s dynamic and often combustible public sphere.\par \par \uc2 The family spent a brief period in Cape Town, South Africa, during his early childhood, while his father taught at the \uc2 University of Cape Town\uc2 . In 1998, when Zohran was just seven years old and entering the Rahu dasha (April 1998 \u8211\'20\'13 April 2016), they relocated to New York City. He was enrolled at the progressive Bank Street School and later attended the Bronx High School of Science - a rigorous academic \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  that shaped his analytical instincts but never dimmed his idealism. Even as a teenager, Mamdani gravitated toward activism and community-based advocacy, informed not just by his upbringing but by a deeply intuitive sensitivity to inequality.\par \par \uc2 He went on to study Africana Studies at \uc2 Bowdoin College\uc2  in Maine, graduating in 2014 during the final phase of his Rahu dasha, Moon bhukti (September 2013 \u8211\'20\'13 March 2015). There, he co-founded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine - a formative step that placed him squarely within the traditions of liberation politics and international solidarity. After college, he took on a range of roles - with MoveOn.org, with TexPIRG, and later as a foreclosure prevention counsellor in Queens. He also stepped into the world of music and satire, performing as \u8220\'20\'1CYoung Cardamom\u8221\'20\'1D in the viral track \u8220\'20\'1C#1 Spice,\u8221\'20\'1D featured in his mother\u8217\'20\'19s film Queen of Katwe. These early years, meandering on the surface, were in fact stitching together a multifaceted understanding of culture, policy, and the personal cost of systemic failure.\par \par \uc2 Mamdani officially became a US citizen in 2018 during the Jupiter dasha, Saturn bhukti (May 2018 \u8211\'20\'13 December 2020). That same year, he served as campaign manager for journalist Ross Barkan\u8217\'20\'19s state senate run and later joined Tiffany Cab\u225\'00\'E1n\u8217\'20\'19s DA campaign as a field organiser. In October 2019, he announced his own candidacy for the New York State Assembly, taking on incumbent Aravella Simotas in the 36th District - all during the Jupiter dasha, Saturn bhukti. He won the Democratic primary in June 2020, a stunning upset for a candidate with no institutional backing, and was elected unopposed later that year. On January 1, 2021, he took office as an assemblyman during his Jupiter dasha, Mercury bhukti (December 2020 \u8211\'20\'13 March 2023), and his entry into elected politics was marked by immediate action.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, during the same Jupiter-Mercury period, he joined a hunger strike alongside taxi drivers fighting for medallion debt relief, helping secure a $450 million deal. He proposed sweeping policies, from fare-free public transit to a public housing authority. By 2023, his fare-free bus pilot in Queens was live. He opposed polluting power plants in Astoria, advocated for universal childcare, and supported calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Supporters hailed him as principled and bold. Critics questioned the legislative follow-through. But it was clear by then: Mamdani wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just another assemblyman - he was building something.\par \par \uc2 In October 2024, he made the most audacious move yet and announced his candidacy for Mayor of New York City during his Jupiter dasha, Venus bhukti (February 2024 \u8211\'20\'13 October 2026). It was a high-stakes leap - one that signalled not just ambition, but belief. And it\u8217\'20\'19s here, just as he stepped into the crucible of one of America\u8217\'20\'19s most visible political races, that a brief detour into his birth chart offers a striking window into the kind of leadership he brings.\par \par \uc2 Mamdani\u8217\'20\'19s chart is led by Cancer rising - a sign known for its emotional intuition, approachability, and deep connection to people\u8217\'20\'19s lived experiences. This ascendant gives him a warm, caring exterior; someone who listens closely, speaks thoughtfully, and remembers the details that make people feel seen. But behind that outer softness is a core of iron: his Moon, the ruler of the chart, sits in Capricorn. That placement suggests a man who has learned to be emotionally self-sufficient, who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t wear his heart on his sleeve, and who processes the weight of public life with stoic, almost managerial calm. It\u8217\'20\'19s a combination - Cancer rising, Capricorn Moon - that explains his dual image: at once empathetic and relentless.\par \par \uc2 Most of his planets cluster in Libra, the sign of justice, diplomacy, and public life. His Sun, Mercury, Mars, and Pluto are all in the sign of the Scales. He is, astrologically, the quintessential politician - not in the transactional sense, but in the idealistic sense: someone who wants to build bridges, restore balance, and channel conversation into consensus. Mercury in Libra makes him a gifted communicator. Mars here makes him strategic rather than aggressive. Pluto adds weight - his ideals are not passing fancies, but tectonic in scope.\par \par \uc2 He also has Venus conjunct Jupiter in Leo - a placement that brings charisma, generosity, and flair. There\u8217\'20\'19s a theatricality to him, not in the showman sense, but in how he connects with large groups and makes people feel inspired. It explains the polish of his campaign videos, the poetry of his public statements, and the genuine affection many supporters feel for him. Yet grounding all of this is his Saturn in Capricorn - strong, no-nonsense, and results-driven. It\u8217\'20\'19s the signature of someone who isn\u8217\'20\'19t here for applause; he\u8217\'20\'19s here to build something that lasts.\par \par \uc2 A few days back, that blend of empathy and endurance delivered a political shockwave. In the Democratic primary, Mamdani defeated former Governor \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2  in a stunning upset, becoming the presumptive nominee for Mayor of New York City - all unfolding under the Jupiter dasha, Venus bhukti. Earlier this month, he had secured endorsements from \uc2 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\uc2  and Bernie Sanders, solidifying his place as the leading progressive in the race. The campaign, driven by over 46,000 volunteers, was a masterclass in organising - grassroots, relentless, and digitally fluent. On TikTok and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , Mamdani didn\u8217\'20\'19t just communicate - he built a narrative. His posts blended humour, policy, and personality, all hallmarks of a chart that mixes Leo showmanship with Libran messaging.\par \par \uc2 The tremors of his primary win were felt far beyond City Hall. Billionaire hedge fund manager \uc2 Bill Ackman\uc2  told Fortune.com that he and his allies were prepared to pour \u8220\'20\'1Chundreds of millions of dollars\u8221\'20\'1D into the mayoral race, calling the \u8220\'20\'1Crisk/reward of running for mayor over the next 132 days extremely compelling.\u8221\'20\'1D While it\u8217\'20\'19s unclear who exactly Ackman intends to support, the implication was obvious: Mamdani\u8217\'20\'19s momentum had unsettled the city\u8217\'20\'19s financial establishment.\par \par \uc2 Amid the political storm, Mamdani also entered a new chapter in his personal life. He married Syrian-born artist Rama Duwaji earlier this year, also during the Jupiter-Venus period - a union that mirrors his own cultural and ideological journey, transnational, expressive, and rooted in shared values. Duwaji, whose art explores displacement and belonging, has since been a quiet but thoughtful presence on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Now, with just a few months until the general election, Zohran Mamdani stands poised to make history - not just as a progressive insurgent or a DSA member, but as potentially the first Muslim and first Indian-American mayor of New York City. His critics see him as untested, ideologically rigid, and lacking in executive experience. His supporters see a man who listens with compassion, leads with conviction, and sees politics as a form of service rather than spectacle. What\u8217\'20\'19s undeniable is that Mamdani has already reshaped the political conversation.\par \par \uc2 Astrologically, Zohran Mamdani stands at the threshold of an extraordinary transformation. The year ahead is not just another chapter \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s a turning point. His public image will undergo a profound shift, and the sharp edges of opposition may begin to soften as even his critics are drawn toward a middle ground. His stature is set to rise in ways that will surprise many and firmly establish his place in the political imagination. No matter how heavily resourced his opponents may be, the tide is with him. The astral \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  points toward a sweeping victory in the mayoral election on November 4, 2025. This is more than momentum - this is destiny. His time has come. Zohran Mamdani will be unstoppable.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the publication.\par \par \uc2 Document ABPBUS0020250628el6s0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw210\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3150\pichgoal600

One voice has gone completely silent in its wake\b0\par\par\uc2 Nick O'Malley \par \uc2 1,179 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2025\par 02:30 PM\par \uc2 The Sydney Morning Herald - Online\par \uc2 SMHHOL\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited. \uc2 www.smh.com.au\uc2 . Not available for redistribution \par \par \uc2 In the darkness of the cinema during screenings of Sir David Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s new film, Ocean, it is not uncommon to hear members of the audience weep for what they have lost, or more specifically, what has been taken from them as they looked elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 At 99, Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s voice is still strong, and his capacity to move people with revelations of the astonishing world around them is undiminished.\par \par \uc2 Now there is growing evidence that of the many tens of documentaries he has presented or created over his career, Ocean is having the most immediate impact of them all.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI believe Ocean will prove to be Sir David\u8217\'20\'19s masterpiece,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Andrew Forrest\uc2 , the billionaire \uc2 Fortescue Metals Group\uc2  chairman, whose Minderoo Pictures provided almost half the film\u8217\'20\'19s funding, and who recently attended its world premiere in London last month with Attenborough and King Charles.\par \par \uc2 The film (its full title is Ocean with David Attenborough) focuses on the wonder of our seas, and their centrality to life on earth, and reveals how rapidly they are being pillaged and destroyed by industrial fishing.\par \par \uc2 Of all Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s films, it is his most political. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have drained the life from our ocean. Now we are almost out of time,\u8221\'20\'1D he says at one point.\par \par \uc2 One particular sequence in the film appears to having a profound impact not only on audiences, but on politicians and policymakers.\par \par \uc2 Having established the extraordinary beauty and complexity of life in the shallow waters of the world\u8217\'20\'19s continental shelves, the camera follows the chains of a bottom trawling net to the ocean floor. In the blue-green murk, it is a scene from a horror movie.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFrom the surface you would have no idea that this was happening,\u8221\'20\'1D says Attenborough in the narration. \u8220\'20\'1CIt has remained hidden from view, until now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Attenborough describes how modern industrial bottom trawlers scrape {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/a-battery-in-a-rock-the-ancient-treasures-kilometres-under-the-sea-20230407-p5cyw6.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the delicate ecosystem of the ocean floor}}}\uc2  with a chain, directing all the sea creatures above into its net.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt smashes its way across the seabed, destroying nearly everything in its path, often on the hunt for just a single species. Almost everything else is discarded. Over three-quarters of a trawler\u8217\'20\'19s catch may be thrown away,\u8221\'20\'1D says Attenborough.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch a fish.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This practice, Attenborough explains, mows down an area the size of the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  rainforest each year, and the wastelands left in the wake of the trawlers leak carbon dioxide into the atmosphere rather than suck it down to the seabed as they did when healthy.\par \par \uc2 The practice is not only allowed in many protected marine areas, says Attenborough, but subsidised by many governments.\par \par \uc2 The movie, and this sequence in particular, became a focal point at a \uc2 UN\uc2  oceans conference held earlier this month, at which 19 new nations ratified a global high-seas treaty to protect oceans, bringing the total number to 51, and at which momentum to restrict bottom trawling gathered pace.\par \par \uc2 This was no accident, says the film\u8217\'20\'19s co-director, Keith Scholey, who has collaborated with Attenborough for more than 40 years. He describes how he and underwater cameraman Doug Anderson approached him with the idea to make the film out of frustration that previous \uc2 UN\uc2  oceans conferences had passed by largely unreported, and therefore world governments did little to control the powerful global fishing industry.\par \par \uc2 Bottom trawling, says Scholey, is a method of fishing that has hardly changed in the 400 years since it was invented, except in scale and take.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe techniques used are pretty Victorian,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd what is absolutely shocking, is that it is completely blind. The guy in the boat, pulling the net has got no idea what on earth that thing is doing down there.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This is what he and Anderson sought to change. If people could see what was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/a-battery-in-a-rock-the-ancient-treasures-kilometres-under-the-sea-20230407-p5cyw6.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 happening on the ocean floor}}}\uc2 , they would not let it keep happening. No one had ever successfully captured clear vision of the practice.\par \par \uc2 Anderson\u8217\'20\'19s team developed and built cameras to withstand the violence of the sequence, and arranged to work with a non-government organisation in Turkey that had secured a commercial trawler to study the impact of the practice. (The team had first considered a site in British waters, but when they dropped the net and the cameras they discovered a patch of rare pink sea fans that grow just millimetres a year. They aborted the run and the location has now been protected.)\par \par \uc2 For a film that is sometimes painful to watch, Ocean, made for National Geographic, has had extraordinary reach. In the UK and Ireland, it had the highest grossing opening for a nature documentary on record; the highest documentary opening of this decade; and the widest released documentary ever, playing in 580 sites, according to Minderoo.\par \par \uc2 The bottom trawling sequence has now been watched on various online portals more than 20 million times.\par \par \uc2 The film\u8217\'20\'19s backers ensured that most of the \uc2 British government\uc2  delegation that travelled to the \uc2 UN\uc2  conference had seen it before departure. At the conference, Britain announced new marine protection zones and new restrictions on bottom trawling. Australian \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Minister Murray Watt watched Ocean during his flight to the event. He says the film underlined for him the urgency with which we need to act to protect the world\u8217\'20\'19s oceans, and was seen at the conference as a call to action.\par \par \uc2 (He adds that Australia\u8217\'20\'19s decision to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2025/06/australia%E2%80%99s-government-pledging-better-protection-our-vulnerable-seas-%E2%80%93-will-it-work"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 increase protection of 30 per cent of its waters by 2030}}}\uc2 , a decision that was celebrated at the \uc2 UN\uc2  conference, was taken before he saw the film.)\par \par \uc2 The film is now being shown by universities and schools, charities and environmental groups. Richard Leck, who heads \uc2 WWF\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s marine \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Australia and is a veteran oceans campaigner, says from its work around the world \uc2 WWF\uc2  is aware that heads of state, ministers and industry bodies have all seen the film.\par \par \uc2 Author {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.saltwire.com/newfoundland-labrador/gwynne-dyer-how-david-attenboroughs-film-will-get-bottom-trawling-banned"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Gwynne Dyer wrote earlier this month}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CWith a single film clip, [Attenborough] has signed the death warrant for one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most destructive industries: bottom trawling. The companies and countries that do it will go down fighting, and it will take time, but they will go down.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Scholey is gratified by the response and notes that one voice has gone remarkably quiet \u8211\'20\'13 that of the global fishing giants. He believes the industry is aware of the regard the world has for Attenborough.\par \par \uc2 He recalls how Attenborough once told him, \u8220\'20\'1C \u8216\'20\'18If I say stuff, people listen, and so I have to be sure, completely sure, that I\u8217\'20\'19m right.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe cumulative effect of that is that he\u8217\'20\'19s become completely trusted, so taking on the trust of the word of David Attenborough is a difficult thing to kind of do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Get to the heart of what\u8217\'20\'19s happening with \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.smh.com.au/category/slug-20250628-p592px"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sign up for our fortnightly \b  \highlight22Environment\b0 \highlight22  newsletter.}}}\par \par \uc2 YXJ0aWNsZTphZjExNjRmMy04NTUwLTQwMTQtOWZlZC02Nzk4OTNkODU4OTk \par \par \uc2 Document SMHHOL0020250627el6r0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw102\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1530\pichgoal600

Director: Gustav M\u246\'00\'F6ller. Script: Gustav M\u246\'00\'F6ller, Emil Nygaard Albertsen. Cinematography: Jasper Spanning. Editing: Rasmus Stensgaard Madsen. Cast: Sidse Babett Knudsen, Sebastian Bull, Dar Slaim, Marina Bouras, Olaf Johannessen, Jacob Lohmann. Running time: 98 minutes. Rating: Suitable for ages 13 and older. Our opinion: fair.\par \par \uc2 Revenge has an improbable starting point: the story begins with the transfer of a convict to the prison block where Eva, a prison guard whose son was killed precisely by that new inmate, works.\par \par \uc2 It is important to point out this initial maneuver because if there is something that characterizes this film by Gustav M\u246\'00\'F6ller (the same of the good psychological thriller, debut film premiered at Sundance, of which there was a prompt in the lead role) is manipulation.\par \par \uc2 There are too many scenes in which M\u246\'00\'F6ller resorts to commonplaces and underlining to give an account of what he wants to tell, as if he had no confidence in an attentive and minimally astute spectator. In Revenge, while one scene is taking place, it is not difficult to predict what will happen in the next one, because the strings of the person who pulls the characters like puppets are always noticeable.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult for a prison system like the Danish one, considered one of the most organized in the world, to have such a major flaw and propitiate the encounter of a murderer with the mother of his victim, for example. Apart from that premise far from logic, Revenge is proposed as a story that raises questions about justice, redemption and the limits of forgiveness through the relationship that this woman naturally disturbed by what she has to live must weave with an enemy who does not suspect anything about her identity until the revelation comes, closer to the epilogue.\par \par \uc2 Sidse Babett Knudsen (known internationally for her great work in the series) is a great actress. Even with such a weak script, she manages to make her work very solvent. She knows how to reveal the character's pent-up anger and inner dilemmas. Also good is the work of her adversary, Mikkel (Sebastian Bull), who is assigned to the maximum security sector of the prison because of his dangerousness. Bull manages to build a complex profile. He is a hostile and at first glance disturbing young man who has obvious difficulties controlling his temper. But behind that mask, a childish behavior emerges that M\u246\'00\'F6ller highlights with an expected move: the conflictive bond with Eva begins to insinuate certain filial approaches, even when he always sustains the extortive threat to digitize him.\par \par \uc2 M\u246\'00\'F6ller works the atmosphere well, though: Revenge takes place in a suffocating \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with the prison architecture (it was filmed almost entirely in the extinct Vridsl\u248\'00\'F8selille prison in Copenhagen) and the sound design as important pieces to create a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  of constant tension that also contributes to what ends up being the great enigma of the film: what goes through Eva's head in each situation. Because her poise and empathy (she teaches writing and yoga classes at the prison, has a cordial relationship with her fellow inmates and with most of the prisoners) begin to falter with the arrival of Mikkel. And her reactions from then on are much less predictable.\par \par \uc2 It is also striking that none of her outbursts have any consequences: even giving the film the benefit of the fact that planting drugs and spitting on an inmate's food can be disguised in this hyper-vigilant \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Eva also gives Mikkel a brutal beating that does not result in any sanction simply because the script imperatively needs the two rivals to remain inseparable. Fiction demands credulity and is allowed license, but in Revenge what breaks down more than once is the very internal logic of the story.\par \par \uc2 By Alejandro LingentiReviewsFilm PremieresWhat comes outAccording to\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250626el6q0022e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

The controversy intensified after the trailer of the movie came out which featured Hain with Diljit. Following the tragic terrorist attack in Pahalgam (April 22), after which India-Pakistan relations deteriorated significantly, Pak actors have been banned in India.\par \par \uc2 Amid calls for a ban on the film by the \uc2 Federation of Western India Cine Employees\uc2  (FWICE), the filmmakers issued a public statement on Tuesday (June 24), clarifying their stance.\par \par \uc2 In an official note posted to \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , the makers emphasised that Sardaar Ji 3 had completed production prior to the Pahalgam incident. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is to bring to everyone's kind notice that the film named, Sardaar Ji 3, was shot well before the prevailing situation that our country is facing now and it was never ever the case that any Pakistani artist was signed or was engaged after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam,\u8221\'20\'1D the statement read.\par \par \uc2 The producers reiterated their commitment to national sentiment, saying, \u8220\'20\'1CWe stand united with our country and our fellow countrymen during this sensitive time. Considering the same, we had decided not to release the film or any of its promotional content in India until the situation becomes opportune.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The controversy took center stage after the film's trailer was released on June 22, confirming Hania Aamir\u8217\'20\'19s involvement\u8212\'20\'14something that had only been speculated until then. The backlash was immediate. \uc2 FWICE\uc2 , in particular, warned Diljit Dosanjh of potential consequences if the film was released, even overseas. The trailer, meanwhile, remains geo-blocked in India.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Diljit Dosanjh addressed the issue directly, explaining that the circumstances surrounding the film\u8217\'20\'19s release were beyond their control. \u8220\'20\'1CJab yeh film bani thi tab situation sab theek tha. We shot this in Feb and then everything was fine. Uske baad, bohut saari badi cheezein humare haath mein nahi hain. Toh producers ne decide kiya ki film obviously ab India mein toh nahi lagegi, toh overseas release karte hain,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen the film was being made, the situation was totally different,\u8221\'20\'1D he added, defending the team\u8217\'20\'19s decisions and clarifying that the producers had no ill intent. The film is now set for an overseas-only release on June 27, 2025.\par \par \uc2 The teaser released earlier this year did not include Hania Aamir, and her involvement remained under wraps until the trailer\u8217\'20\'19s debut. The timing of this reveal\u8212\'20\'14coinciding with a tense political \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14sparked outrage.\par \par \uc2 Notably, this isn't the first cross-border film to face consequences in recent months. Actor Fawad Khan's much-anticipated return to Indian cinema with Abir Gulaal was also halted, unable to release due to the sensitive political \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  post the Pahalgam attack.\par \par \uc2 Also Read: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.moneycontrol.com/entertainment/after-sunjay-kapur-s-death-wife-priya-sachdev-joins-sona-comstar-board-amid-succession-shift-article-13175255.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 After Sunjay Kapur\u8217\'20\'19s death, wife Priya Sachdev joins Sona Comstar board amid succession shift}}}\par \par \uc2 Amid the storm, Diljit Dosanjh has continued promoting the film abroad. On Tuesday, he shared a humorous video of himself enjoying food in London, captioned: \u8220\'20\'1CSARDAAR JI 3 Advance Bookings Open Now Only on Overseas. Releasing 27th JUNE 2025.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As the controversy unfolds, the makers remain firm in their stance that the casting occurred under very different circumstances, stating once again: \u8220\'20\'1CNo Pakistani artist was engaged after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document MONECT0020250625el6p000dz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

On top if this comes \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change with reef acidification, coral bleaching, warming sea temperatures, rising sea levels, and increased variability in wind."\par \par \uc2 Between January and March this year, the project team spoke to more than 250 people on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, providing insight into why the sea is important to them, and to understand the nature of their activities, the challenges they face, and the changes they have seen.\par \par \uc2 Dr Christie explained: "Some of these interviewees spoke on camera and their stories have been included in the documentary. Filmed across Zanzibar and Pemba, Bahari ni Maisha Yetu is a call to action, a reminder that protecting the sea is a shared responsibility that begins by listening to those living closer to its tides.\par \par \uc2 "In the documentary they explain some of many challenges they face as a result of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change effects including the reduction of fish stocks, increasing unpredictability in the weather and rising sea levels and how share how their strategies for adaptation. Their stories are a call to action: to help them to protect the sea, protect their livelihoods and ensure their futures.\par \par \uc2 "It has been a real privilege to have been able to work with these communities, to hear their stories and, through this documentary, to provide a space for them to share their experiences of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change on a major international platform."\par \par \uc2 Professor Horton added: "It's a great tribute to the hard work of the team that we have been included in the Zanzibar International Film Festival. Our film has a strong message about the \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  of these fishing communities as they face the challenge of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change in the Indian Ocean".\par \par \uc2 While in Tanzania, the team also led workshops with women to co-create graphic novels that convey their experiences and the ways \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is affecting their livelihoods and lives.\par \par \uc2 While some of these highlighted the hardships and impacts on social cohesion arising from the effects of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, they also showcased the value the women placed in the importance of villagers coming together to promote \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and environmental regeneration.\par \par \uc2 The team's findings will be examined comparatively to identify now to better support the resilience of these communities and their heritage.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer\par \par \uc2 Royal Agricultural University\uc2  published this content on June 24, 2025, and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.

As part of this, the company is designing, manufacturing, operating, and commercializing solutions for space launch and mobility that are competitive and sustainable.\par \par \uc2 Included in this is MaiaSpace's cost-effective mini launch vehicle with a reusable first stage.\par \par \uc2 "We are focusing on launching spacecraft that are really bound to the Earth economy and that have a meaningful impact on Earth," says Jerome Vila, MaiaSpace's chief product officer.\par \par \uc2 MaiaSpace's work can provide important data - such as seismic activity detection and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  research data - that will benefit the people of Earth.\par \par \uc2 Jerome Vila, chief product officer, MaiaSpace\par \par \uc2 Relativity Space\par \par \uc2 Rockets may be fast, but their development process typically isn't.\par \par \uc2 "Right now, there is a huge demand to get satellites and spacecraft up off the ground and into space, but as a planet, we do not have enough rockets to get them there," says Jacqueline Sotraidis Schell, senior propulsion engineer at \uc2 Relativity Space\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To address this need, \uc2 Relativity Space\uc2  is aiming to not only build rockets faster but also to create designs that are smarter and more affordable.\par \par \uc2 In doing so, the company hopes to revolutionize traditional rocket development and meet the growing demand for getting spacecraft into space.\par \par \uc2 Jacqueline Sotraidis Schell, senior propulsion engineer, \uc2 Relativity Space\par \par \uc2 Launching a New Era of Exploration and Technological Advancement by Simulating Space\par \par \uc2 Those working in the space industry are constantly making the impossible possible, and this is happening at an increasingly accelerated rate.\par \par \uc2 To achieve this rate of growth, innovators are turning to \uc2 Ansys\uc2  simulation solutions to rigorously, efficiently, and accurately test and develop designs that can handle the harsh space \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  - all while minimizing costs and reducing timelines. "Simulation for us is a force multiplier," says Soloff.\par \par \uc2 With the help of \uc2 Ansys\uc2  simulation, those working in the space industry hope to address some of humanity's largest challenges today and build a positive future. This includes everything from using simulation to confidently plan missions and design assets to protecting these assets and exploring the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\par \par \uc2 If you'd like to discover more about space innovation and the role of simulation and digital engineering in this industry, check out the full documentary on oursimulating space site, which will be continuously evolving with new resources and inspirational stories.\par \par \uc2 Search\par \par \uc2 Just for you.

If the world fails to address it, and over the rest of this century we continue to burn fossil fuels and pump even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 we\u8217\'20\'19ll face catastrophe}}}\uc2 . On this much, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://unfccc.int/about-us/about-the-secretariat"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 almost all governments agree}}}\uc2  (with some notable exceptions {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 such as the US}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Even the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest oil and gas companies {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.shell.com/sustainability/climate.html#vanity-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hlbGwuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L291ci1jbGltYXRlLXRhcmdldC5odG1s"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 now acknowledge}}}\uc2  that their products are behind the alarming increase in global temperatures and that we will have to transition to alternative fuels. Eventually.\par \par \uc2 In some oil and gas firms\u8217\'20\'19 net zero policies you will often see the word "eventually" or its equivalent used. Yes, they accept that the age of fossil fuels will be over, but they don\u8217\'20\'19t give any end date. In fact, with continued expansion of new oil and gas fields they appear to give every indication of continuing to be fossil fuel companies for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theconversation.com/uk/newsletters?promoted=the-daily-2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sign up to our daily newsletter}}}\uc2  to receive all The Conversation UK\u8217\'20\'19s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences.\par \par \uc2 Will such firms actually phase out coal, oil and gas at the rate required to avoid dangerous \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change? How quickly does that now have to happen? Immediately.\par \par \uc2 At current rates of emissions, the window to have a 50:50 chance of limiting warming to 1.5\u176\'00\'B0C will close in as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://globalcarbonbudget.org/key-targets/#:~:text=At%20the%20GCB%20we%20calculate,tons%20of%20CO%E2%82%82%2C%20respectively."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 little as six years}}}\uc2 . Given that global emissions are not stabilising but in fact going up, we are in the process of overshooting 1.5\u176\'00\'B0C and heading deep into dangerous \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change territory.\par \par \uc2 Does that mean it\u8217\'20\'19s game over, that the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  catastrophes we fear will come to pass? Thinking about these sorts of systemic risks form the basis of much of my {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/14/1171/2023/esd-14-1171-2023.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 current research}}}\uc2 . This includes some pretty alarming analysis on how societies can react to challenges such as \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change in ways that can {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/15/1179/2024/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 make the situation much worse}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But herein lies a potentially powerful source of hope for the future because what we do as individuals and members of communities and countries will make all the difference. That\u8217\'20\'19s what was on my mind when I started working on a new \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change documentary with filmmaker {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://climate.film/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Paul Maple}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Radical reductions\par \par \uc2 Our new film {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub5I_x8impk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 System Update: Rebooting Our Future}}}\uc2  argues that, while we may have run out of time to avoid dangerous \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, we are now only beginning to see how we can not just avoid further environmental damage but make a much better world for all of humanity. To do that, we must go beyond the incremental and timid policies of today. We need to be radical and dig into the drivers of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 Take economic growth, for example. You will not find a political party in power in any industrialised nation that does not have continued economic growth as one of its core objectives. Economic performance is often the main way politicians are judged. That\u8217\'20\'19s why threats of a recession {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/05/the-big-squeeze-what-the-papers-say-about-bank-of-englands-recession-forecast"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lead news reports}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In System Update, I ask what is this economic growth for, if it continues to drive expanded energy and material consumption and drive us further towards \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  and ecological collapse?\par \par \uc2 If our economic and political systems cannot deliver radical emissions reductions in a sustainable and fair way, then they need to be rebooted. Rather than policies being orientated towards maximising economic growth, we can instead question how the current goods and services an economy produces are used.\par \par \uc2 How can local communities be empowered to make themselves more resilient to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change while reducing their emissions? Where can {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.involve.org.uk/resource/citizens-assembly"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 citizen assemblies}}}\uc2  strengthen our democracies and help foster the wider support for ambitious \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  action? These assemblies work by recruiting a representative cross section of society who hear from a range of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  experts, and then work together to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.climateassembly.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 provide policy recommendations}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I put such questions to an amazing group of activists, academics and policymakers. We quickly discovered from economic anthropologist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jasonhickel.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jason Hickel}}}\uc2  that there is no end of new thinking about economics.\par \par \uc2 Lawyer and key architect of the Paris agreement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.farhanayamin.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Farhana Yamin}}}\uc2  recounted the epic battle that she and others have been waging with politicians to get them to understand and act on some of the fundamental truths of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. Researcher and strategist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://laurielaybourn.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Laurie Laybourn}}}\uc2  spoke of the need for leaders to understand how this gathering storm of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change demands new mindsets.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change adaptation expert {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sei.org/people/kathryn-brown/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Kathryn Brown}}}\uc2  made the case for a rapid increase in efforts to protect communities from environmental change, while \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  historian {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wmo.int/profile/alice-bell"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Alice Bell}}}\uc2  put today\u8217\'20\'19s debates into the wider context. \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  campaigner {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/max-wakefield"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Max Wakefield}}}\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  justice activist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dylanstruthhamilton.wordpress.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dylan Hamilton}}}\uc2  connected the big picture elements of the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis to both everyday actions like what you buy and how to you travel, to deeper engagement with politics.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s easy to feel overwhelmed about the scale of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. There is a constant stream of bad news about rising temperatures and extreme weather. What I hope System Update shows is that there is no end of ideas for how such an outcome could be averted, and how you could put them into practice.\par \par \uc2 We will win.

But nothing quite prepared me for the dynamic, complex and astonishingly forward-looking country I would encounter.\par \par \uc2 My maiden trip to India was more than just a journey through one of the world's oldest civilisations. It was an immersive journey into a country that masterfully blends ancient tradition with cutting-edge modernity. From the bustling streets of Mumbai, India's financial powerhouse, to the timeless grandeur of the Taj Mahal, India is a living paradox. It's chaotic yet organised, ancient yet futuristic.\par \par \uc2 For a Zimbabwean journalist seeking insights into issues around development, governance and economic growth, this was an eye-opener in the truest sense.\par \par \uc2 My first stop was Mumbai, India's financial nerve centre. Standing before the Gateway of India, a colonial-era monument that once welcomed British viceroys and now beckons millions of tourists, I was struck by how symbols of the past coexist with the city's effervescent present. This monumental archway was built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Construction began in 1915 and was completed in 1924, and it served as a symbolic entrance for British dignitaries and later, as a departure point for British troops after India's independence.\par \par \uc2 The structure, designed in the Indo-Saracenic style, offers a blend of Indian and Islamic architectural elements and is a popular tourist attraction.\par \par \uc2 A short walk away is the National Museum of Indian Cinema, a tribute to Bollywood's journey, from grainy silent films to the global blockbusters of today. Visiting Film City, the heart of India's cinematic dream factory, was like walking through a world powered not by money alone, but by stories and aspiration. The Indian film industry employs millions, not only boosting the economy but also preserving cultural identity, a model Zimbabwe's small but growing film sector can emulate.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the most thrilling initiation into daily Indian life was my first ride in a 'tuk-tuk', the ubiquitous yellow-and-black three-wheeled motor tricycle. Weaving through the kaleidoscope of Mumbai traffic, our driver navigated with uncanny skill between honking cars, bustling street vendors and even the occasional jaywalking cows roaming the streets. In that short ride, I understood the genius of India's transportation system, which is simple, scalable and accessible. For just a few rupees, you can get anywhere, fast. Zimbabwe's cities, which are choked with private cars and an unreliable public system, could adopt a similar model for short-distance, last-mile mobility in urban areas.\par \par \uc2 The pace and scale of India's financial systems is amazing. At the Mumbai Stock Exchange (BSE), Asia's oldest, I watched billions of dollars shift across trading screens in real time. What stood out wasn't just the wealth traded here but the effort to democratise access to investment.\par \par \uc2 India's economy has surged from a US$270 billion economy to US$4 trillion in just three decades, despite being classified as a lower middle income country. It is the world's fifth largest economy behind the United States, China, Germany and Japan.\par \par \uc2 With the rise of mobile trading applications and investor education, ordinary Indians are becoming stakeholders in their economy, a critical lesson for Zimbabwe's own financial inclusion strategies. Our hosts took us to the \uc2 National Payments Corporation of India\uc2  (NPCI), the brain behind \uc2 Unified Payments Interface (UPI)\uc2 ), a real-time payment system that has revolutionised cashless transactions. Street vendors, rickshaw drivers and major retailers alike use QR codes and apps for instant payments. This digital leap, which is built on government-private sector collaboration, holds immense relevance for Zimbabwe's informal sector, which still struggles with financial exclusion and unreliable mobile money services.\par \par \uc2 One of the more instructive sessions was with the \uc2 Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)\uc2 , a 125-year-old body that acts as a bridge between businesses and government. \uc2 CII\uc2 's structured engagement with policy-makers has helped shape reforms that fuel India's industrialisation. At the \uc2 Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India\uc2 , I saw how India became the 'pharmacy of the world.' Through strategic investments in research, generic drug manufacturing and strong export policies, India supplies affordable medicine globally. With Zimbabwe's own rich biodiversity, the country could develop its own herbal and pharmaceutical sector with similar focus, especially given the growing global demand for alternative medicine.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most impressive feat of engineering I saw was the Atal Setu, India's longest sea bridge, linking Mumbai with Navi Mumbai. Named after former Prime Minister \uc2 Atal Bihari Vajpayee\uc2 , it is not just a marvel of architecture but a symbol of how infrastructure can ease congestion, stimulate trade and save billions in lost productivity. The \uc2 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)\uc2 , Asia's richest civic body, showcased what effective city management looks like. From smart waste disposal to digitised public health systems, BMC is proof that local governments can be engines of progress if they are resourced, transparent and responsive. For Zimbabwe's local authorities, often hamstrung by lack of capacity and resources, this is a compelling model.\par \par \uc2 A visit to the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (\uc2 CDRI\uc2 ) added a global dimension to India's developmental priorities. \uc2 CDRI\uc2  works to ensure that infrastructure - from roads to hospitals - can withstand \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  shocks. Given that both Zimbabwe and India are vulnerable to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 -related disasters, partnerships with institutions like \uc2 CDRI\uc2  could help Zimbabwe build not just back, but better.\par \par \uc2 At Doordarshan, India's state-run broadcaster, we learnt how public media can be both a cultural archive and an information powerhouse. Unlike many state broadcasters in Africa, Doordarshan has embraced digital, diversified its content and remained relevant in a competitive media \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We visited the National Museum in New Delhi, also known as the National Museum of India, which is one of the largest museums in India. Established in 1949, it holds a variety of articles ranging from the pre-historic era to modern works of art. We also explored India's deep cultural and historical heritage at the National Museum in New Delhi, home to artefacts spanning 5 000 years.\par \par \uc2 The final leg of our journey took us to Agra, where the Taj Mahal, an immense mausoleum of white marble commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. She died giving birth to their 14th child. Shah Jahan, heartbroken, decided to build a monument to immortalise their love. Construction began in 1632 and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, with the surrounding buildings and gardens finished five years later. It's considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, blending Indian, Persian and Islamic styles.\par \par \uc2 The Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.\par \par \uc2 India is not without its challenges as inequality, pollution and population pressures persist. Yet, what sets it apart is its refusal to be constrained by its problems. It dreams boldly, invests in people and adapts quickly.\par \par \uc2 Zimbabwe, too, is a country of promise. Under the Second Republic, the Government has shown strong commitment to infrastructure development, with projects like the US$300 million Beitbridge Border Post modernisation and the impressive Trabablas Interchange in Harare. The project is part of the road development strategy initiated by the Government which has seen a raft of large-scale road construction and rehabilitation projects underway across the country. These are not mere monuments of concrete, but symbols of connectivity, ambition and economic intent.\par \par \uc2 To accelerate our development, we must invest in local government capacity, digitise public services, modernise transport systems and create space for private sector-led innovation. More importantly, we must also believe in the power of home-grown solutions - just as India has in our ability to write our own success story.\par \par \uc2 As I boarded my flight home, the colours, contradictions and confidence of India lingered with me. I returned not just with souvenirs, but with inspiration and a challenge for Zimbabwe to believe, to act and to build.\par \par \uc2 Document CNICLE0020250624el6n0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

Rubin Observatory Which Is Preparing for a 10-year Ultra-wide, Ultra-deep Movie of the Sky\par \par \uc2 STONY BROOK, NY - June 23, 2025 - \uc2 Stony Brook University\uc2  professors, post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students from the University's Department of\par \par \uc2 Physics and Astronomy in the College of Arts and Sciences are preparing to measure the Universe with the newly constructed \uc2 National Science Foundation\uc2  (NSF)-Department of Energy (DOE) Vera C. Rubin Observatory located on the El Pe\u241\'00\'F1\u243\'00\'F3n peak of Cerro Pach\u243\'00\'F3n in the Andes Mountains in Chile. Today, Rubin Observatory revealed the first set of large, ultra-high-definition images and videos that showcase Rubin's extraordinary capabilities to the world for the first time, at the First Look Event in Washington D.C. Stony Brook researchers celebrated with their colleagues worldwide by hosting a "First Look Watch Party." The Rubin images can be viewed here.\par \par \uc2 The Rubin Observatory looks to capture the cosmos in detail by using the largest camera ever built and will repeatedly scan the sky for 10 years to create the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), an ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the night sky. The science goals for LSST range from exploring the transient Universe, to mapping the Solar System as well as the Milky Way galaxy, and cosmology, i.e. figuring out what the Universe is made of.\par \par \uc2 Stony Brook's main involvement in Rubin is in cosmology. Rubin's LSST will enable precision measurements of the geometry and structure of the Universe in order to study the properties of dark matter and dark energy, the two mysterious components which together make up 95% of the Universe, but whose nature remains unknown. Stony Brook researchers are part of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), one of the largest collaborations in astronomy in the world with more than 1,200 members, as well as of the LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration (SLSC).\par \par \uc2 "The known part of our universe comprises only ~5% of the universe," said Chang Kee Jung, distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. "The other part is composed of 'Dark Energy' and 'Dark Matter,' which we still know little about. The newly constructed Rubin Observatory will provide unprecedented data that will help us to greatly advance our understanding of the universe. As a particle physicist myself, I have a keen interest in this magnificent telescope, not only for its fundamental science goals but also for its technology and participation of a large number of particle physicists in the project. The Stony Brook faculty members, postdocs and students have made significant contributions to the project. I am eager to see the stunning initial images and looking forward to seeing breakthrough findings from this interdisciplinary and mega-science project."\par \par \uc2 Stony Brook Associate Professor Anja von der Linden has been a member of DESC since its inception in 2012 and currently serves on the DESC management team as deputy technical coordinator. The main interest of Professor von der Linden and her research team is cosmology with galaxy clusters, the largest objects in the Universe, and weak gravitational lensing. Beyond DESC, she serves on the Rubin Users Committee and is part of the Rubin commissioning team.\par \par \uc2 "Rubin Observatory can image the entire southern night sky in only three nights and will do so over and over again for 10 years," said Professor von der Linden. "It will capture a 10-year movie of the southern sky, and in the process also acquire the widest, deepest sky image ever taken. Producing 20 terabytes of data per night and issuing 10 million alerts that something changed or moved, per night, it is the next Big Data project for astronomy. This vast amount of data will help astronomers uncover some of the Universe's biggest secrets."\par \par \uc2 Department of Physics and Astronomy faculty also working with the observatory includes assistant professor Simon Birrer, who is the current co-chair of the Strong Lensing Science Collaboration (SLSC), one of eight science collaborations; assistant professor Vivian Miranda, who is a former DESC pipeline scientist and remains active in DESC to search for signatures of dark energy; and associate professor Neelima Sehgal, who is interested in combining the Rubin Observatory findings with cosmic microwave background experiments.\par \par \uc2 "The Rubin Observatory will be a game changer for strong lensing science," said Professor Birrer. "We expect to find hundred times more gravitational lenses to shed light on dark matter and dark energy. The strong lensing community will need to grow their collaborative efforts. With Rubin, we can't do the research alone . Organizing larger research teams will be a shift for the strong lensing community but it's exciting because together we can do something really substantial."\par \par \uc2 The Stony Brook team includes many early career researchers including post-doctoral scholar Dr. Narayan Khadka who serves as a DESC pipeline scientist and will soon move to Chile as Rubin Observing Specialist. Graduate students Radhakrishnan Srinvasan, Prakruth Adari, Benjamin C. Levine, Xiangyu Huang, and Paras Sharma are preparing for cosmology analyses with LSST data, and a number of undergraduate students, Sheina Peralta, Mia LaMontagne, Sofia Castillo, Yixuan Shao, Emrecan Sonmez, Xianzhe Tang and Carly Mistick, are gaining first research experience with related data.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, a number of Stony Brook graduates are part of the Rubin world. Among them, former Stony Brook graduate student Dr. Shuang Liang is now a Rubin observing specialist, working in Chile at the front-row of acquiring the LSST data. Dr. Bryan Field, who received his PhD from the C.N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook, is now program manager in the Department of Energy for the Cosmic Frontier program of which the Rubin Observatory is part.\par \par \uc2 # # #\par \par \uc2 About \uc2 Stony Brook University\par \par \uc2 Stony Brook University\uc2  is New York's flagship university and No. 1 public university.

The main threats are poaching, trafficking, electrical fencing and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Since 2021, in collaboration with the Ministry of \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Tourism, the Namibian Police and various veterinary professionals, the PCRF has rehabilitated and released 37 pangolins.\par \par \uc2 The data collected from these releases is used in \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  action plans and guidelines for the species.\par \par \uc2 GLOBAL RECOGNITION\par \par \uc2 As \u8216\'20\'18Guardians of Eden\u8217\'20\'19 wins gold at ITFFA and celebrates its official selection for the Green Screen Naturfilmfestival in Germany, these accolades underscore Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s ongoing and global recognition as a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  success story.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNamibia is widely recognised as the birthplace of community-based \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This approach was pioneered by visionaries like Garth Owen-Smith and Margaret Jacobsohn, particularly in the Kunene region,\u8221\'20\'1D says Prediger.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat sets Namibia apart is that it was the first African country to enshrine the protection of the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the rights of communities over natural resources in its constitution,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBy empowering local communities \u8211\'20\'13 often those most affected by poverty and human-wildlife conflict \u8211\'20\'13 with ownership and benefits from \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Namibia has created a model where wildlife protection and rural development go hand in hand,\u8221\'20\'1D Prediger says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInstead of relying solely on a \u8220\'20\'1Cfortress \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D model, communal conservancies expand the reach of protected areas, make poaching riskier and foster stewardship by those living closest to the wildlife.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In \u8216\'20\'18Guardians of Eden\u8217\'20\'19, the guardians are the rhino rangers, pangolin trackers and communities themselves. Featuring guardians from the Kunene region as well as from conservancies such as \u8800\'22\'60Khoadi //Hoas, Palmwag, Mayuni and Nyae Nyae, the documentary introduces us to, among esteemed others, Simson Uri-Khob.\par \par \uc2 Uri-Khob is the chief executive of Save The Rhino Trust Namibia (SRT) and has made saving the last free-roaming black rhinos his life\u8217\'20\'19s purpose.\par \par \uc2 In 2021, Uri-Khob was honoured with the Prince William Award for \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Africa, in recognition of the 30 years he has worked to save black rhinos.\par \par \uc2 As Uri-Khob shares stories from the field, expands on training rhino rangers to meet the growing threat of poachers and encourages schoolchildren to become stewards of nature, he has some stern words for those thinking of making a quick buck in the trafficking trade.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe thing is, we know our rhinos by name.\par \par \uc2 You sit there and the guys phone and say: Angeline has been killed.\par \par \uc2 She has been poached. The calf has been shot. Both of them are lying there and bleeding. And I have to go there and see that. It\u8217\'20\'19s really hard,\u8221\'20\'1D says Uri-Khob.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor the local guys, I\u8217\'20\'19ll tell them straight, what you are doing is very bad. You\u8217\'20\'19re doing the dirty work, the hard work.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a risk. You may be killed. Don\u8217\'20\'19t even think about doing it. Stay away,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18BAD LUCK\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can get better out there without killing a rhino. You don\u8217\'20\'19t have to worry about your life. You don\u8217\'20\'19t have to worry about going to jail. You don\u8217\'20\'19t have to worry about your kids suffering. It\u8217\'20\'19s blood money.\par \par \uc2 You will never get somewhere with it. It\u8217\'20\'19s like the old people say: It\u8217\'20\'19s bad luck.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While killing a rhino is bad luck, according to head pangolin ranger Oma Sao the sight of a pangolin is the opposite.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEach and every time when you are hunting around and you see pangolin, a live pangolin, that means you are lucky,\u8221\'20\'1D says Sao, a talented San tracker working with the PCRF in a synthesis of ancient knowledge and technology.\par \par \uc2 Sao learnt to protect pangolins from his grandparents.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe keep them protected because they are our lucky animal.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Alongside figures such as Uri-Khob and Sao, the documentary also honours a host of conservationists doing their part to preserve Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s natural heritage.\par \par \uc2 This, despite the challenges of human-wildlife conflict and the initial reluctance of communities who have had their crops and water sources damaged and even feared for their lives and that of their livestock in the face of free-roaming animals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen I embarked on the journey to create this documentary, I was driven by a deep sense of wonder and admiration for the extraordinary \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts unfolding in Namibia.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Guardians of Eden\u8217\'20\'19 is a testament to the indomitable spirit of local communities, who have come together to rewrite the narrative of \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Africa,\u8221\'20\'1D says Von Hase.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI hope this documentary inspires viewers to appreciate the profound impact of grassroots \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts and the powerful synergy between \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and community,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe story of Namibia is a powerful reminder that with commitment, collaboration and respect for the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we can all contribute to a brighter future for our planet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Responding to an interview in-between a pangolin rescue and release, Prediger expresses the hope that more Namibians watch the film.\par \par \uc2 Guardians of Eden\u8217\'20\'19 was commissioned by MultiChoice Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18Ombura\u8217\'20\'19 initiative, is produced by Moon Valley Films and is now streaming on Showmax.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18WILDLIFE NEEDS PEOPLE\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19d love for more Namibians \u8211\'20\'13 and international audiences \u8211\'20\'13 to see this film and learn about the powerful local stories behind \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  success.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For more than two hours, hundreds of young people sat transfixed before a massive screen at a hotel in Nairobi, witnessing the stark reality of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change\u8217\'20\'19s devastating effects around the world. Flash floods that ravaged cities. Hurricanes that tore through coastal towns. Cyclones that wreaked havoc in one country, while heatwaves scorched another. The images slideshow, interspersed with videos, each more heart-wrenching than the last, flickered across the screen like scenes from a tragedy. A tragic movie, but one that is all too real.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the presentation, \uc2 Al Gore\uc2 , former US vice president for eight years, stood resolutely on stage, offering vital context for each image that flashed across the screen.\par \par \uc2 Now a passionate \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  activist, Gore has dedicated himself to shaping the next generation of environmental leaders. Through his non-profit organisation, \uc2 the \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  Reality Project\uc2 , he and his team have been spearheading global training programmes with a focus on developing countries. These sessions delve into the complexities of the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis and equip participants with the tools to drive meaningful change.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  Action had a sit-down with Gore, 76, on the sidelines of the Nairobi training.\par \par \uc2 What strikes you most about being here in Kenya at the epicentre of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  impacts?\par \par \uc2 I have been to Kenya several times before, but every time I come and especially right now, because I did so much research ahead of my trip, I am extremely impressed with the drive, energy and enthusiasm. The innovative culture, the pride that Kenyans have and its leadership in using renewable energy. There seems to be a collective determination in Kenya to build a bright future. There is an awareness of how serious this challenge is, but also an awareness of how great the opportunities are.\par \par \uc2 Let's talk about "An Inconvenient Truth." When you made that film in 2006, many of your predictions seemed apocalyptic to some. Now, nearly two decades later, we're living many of those realities. Do you ever feel vindicated, or is that the wrong emotion?\par \par \uc2 I supported the scientists who were the ones who made the prediction, and I can tell you that the scientists wish they had been wrong.\par \par \uc2 Also read: Kenya\u8217\'20\'19s carbon market ambitions: Opportunities and controversies\par \par \uc2 Because the scientists were correct in what they warned us decades ago, we should give more attention to what the warning is about now. But also, the development of solutions has been much faster than anyone predicted. I don\u8217\'20\'19t feel any sense of vindication. But I do feel very strongly that we need to listen carefully to what these scientists are telling us now.\par \par \uc2 But here's what troubles many Kenyans: your film reached millions, won an Oscar, and sparked global conversations. Yet the emissions have continued rising. Africa's carbon footprint remains minimal, yet we're paying the highest price. How do you reconcile the awareness you've created with the continued inaction by major emitters?\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s an excellent question, and it is a question that I ask myself quite frequently. I continue to seek the best answer to that question. I wish I could predict with absolute certainty that we are going to solve this crisis in time. We are going to solve it, but there is the remaining question of whether we will do it soon enough. I believe that we will. It all depends on whether or not we can summon political will fast enough.\par \par \uc2 That leads me to a difficult question about \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  justice. Rich nations promised US dollars 100 billion annually for \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  finance - a promise made over a decade ago, still unfulfilled. Meanwhile, Kenya spends over two per cent of its GDP on \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  adaptation. Is this \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  colonialism - the global north exporting its \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  costs to us?\par \par \uc2 First of all, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  justice is social justice. And it is unfair that developing nations have contributed so little to the crisis, yet are suffering some of the worst impacts, and the world as a whole must address that. I think that it\u8217\'20\'19s important to try and understand why these governments in the wealthy countries have been slow to meet their obligations. I think one reason is that in the wake of the rapid globalisation of businesses and industries, some of the voters and taxpayers in the wealthy countries were told by some politicians that their jobs had been shipped overseas. And some of the people in the wealthy countries are feeling poorer than they are because there have been some job losses, so there is political resistance. But it is not justifiable.\par \par \uc2 The development of the energy transition in Kenya and other developing nations is most likely to occur if we can use the same pattern that has worked in the rest of the world. And that is, more than 80 per cent of the financing has come from the private sector. Governments have provided less than 20 per cent financing in the developing countries. So I think the most useful and productive way to address this injustice is to remove the obstacles to more access to financing for nations like Kenya so they can participate in the \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  revolution.\par \par \uc2 You are well-travelled. You've interacted with many players in this field. Is there a carbon credits project that you've seen and thought to yourself, this is a good undertaking of a carbon credits project?\par \par \uc2 I'm trying to think of the best examples I could cite. There are not many, I will say. I don't want to say they have no role to play, but they have to include full input from the communities affected and have high integrity.\par \par \uc2 Some nations are using hydroelectric power to produce green hydrogen, not from fossil fuels, but from separating the hydrogen from the oxygen in H2O, in the water molecules, and then using that green hydrogen to make pollution-free steel. And some of the investors in those projects can get some carbon credits. And I think that if it's documented thoroughly and if you can prove the integrity of the project and demonstrate that no communities are being overlooked and harmed in the process, I think there are examples of where it can work.\par \par \uc2 But there are very few of them, I have to say. And I have been tempted at times to say, no more carbon credits. They're just not working. But I have seen a few examples where I think they are justified.\par \par \uc2 Do you think it's justice for a country that is a polluter to buy carbon credits so that it can continue polluting the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 No, I don't. And the biggest problem I have with carbon credits, well, one of the biggest problems, is the fact that local communities are sometimes not consulted and not involved, and they have to suffer the damage, that's just as big a problem. But another big problem is that some of the carbon credits proposed in the past have simply been an excuse to allow the polluters to continue to pollute.\par \par \uc2 And the number one objective has to be to reduce emissions. Look, we're in a global crisis here. This thin shell of atmosphere, we're all trapped inside of it.\par \par \uc2 And we're using it as an open sewer, and it's trapping so much extra heat, it is doing serious damage to the ecological systems that we depend upon, that our children and grandchildren will depend upon. So if they're using some trickery to pretend that they're reducing emissions and not doing it, that's terrible. It ought to be outlawed. It ought to be prevented.\par \par \uc2 You've spoken about the moral dimension of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. But let's be specific about Africa. We have 600 million people without electricity. Our priority is development, lifting people out of poverty. When wealthy nations tell us not to develop our natural gas reserves or build coal plants, having built their prosperity on exactly that, what moral authority do they have?\par \par \uc2 If the United States, for example, and other wealthier countries began their period of rapid development in an era where the cheapest electricity was solar and wind electricity and batteries; and vehicles were electric, they would have gone in that direction right away. Because the damage done in the wealthy countries by fossil fuels has been extremely high. Now developing countries have the opportunity to leapfrog the mistakes and dirty pathways that were used in such countries.\par \par \uc2 I want to shift to solutions, because that's where Africa is leading. You've seen Kenya's geothermal success, our mobile money systems enabling solar access. What can the world learn from how African communities are adapting and innovating?\par \par \uc2 First of all, think of my dear friend, the late Wangari Maathai. She was a visionary, courageous and one of the greatest people to live in the world. She focused on planting trees to restore the integrity of the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , protecting urban parks, and advocating for the use of indigenous crops that are well-adapted to the different communities.\par \par \uc2 Are you optimistic? Are you making any headway as a promoter of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  action?\par \par \uc2 Yes, I'm optimistic. There is an old saying attributed to an economist in the US years ago, Rudiger Dornbusch. It's known as Dornbusch\u8217\'20\'19s Law, and that law says this: Things take longer to happen than you think they will, but then they happen faster than you thought they could.\par \par \uc2 And finally, if you could speak directly to President \uc2 William Ruto\uc2 , to African leaders, and our readers across Kenya, what's your message?\par \par \uc2 We all face the same choice in life over and over again. The hard right versus the easy wrong. And to save the future of Africa and for all humanity, we have to make the right choices to get away from dirty fossil fuels and the other activities that are creating this \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis. The \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis is far worse than many people realise, but the opportunities to save it are also greater than many understand. If we make the right choice, we will invest our hopes, resources and talents in developing a sustainable future that can give hope to our young people.\par \par \uc2 Lnjeru@ke.nationmedia.com\par \par \uc2 Document DAYNA00020250622el6m0000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc52}{\*\bkmkend toc52}\b \uc2 Searching for Hidden Fungi in the Sonoran Desert\b0\par\par\uc2 3,200 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2025\par \uc2 Inside Climate News\par \uc2 LOST\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2025. Lost Light Projects Inc. \par \par \uc2 SAGUARO NATIONAL PARK, Ariz.\u8212\'20\'14As the sprawl of homes begins to dissipate on the outskirts of Tucson, forests of saguaro cacti rise in its place, their arms twisting and twirling as if waving a welcome to the Sonoran desert. Fields of prickly pears and cholla cactuses, blooming creosote bushes and green-limbed palo verde trees spread beneath and between the beckoning icons of the Southwest.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe look like we\u8217\'20\'19re on a movie set,\u8221\'20\'1D said Justin Stewart as he drove into Saguaro National Park, where the towering cacti, many older than the state of Arizona, are the charismatic stars of the scene. But Stewart and his colleague, Jinsu Elhance, weren\u8217\'20\'19t there for the saguaros, but to see some tiny players with big roles growing in the soil beneath them: mycorrhizal fungi.\par \par \uc2 Though invisible on the surface of the desert, researchers have found in recent decades that mycorrhizal fungi are a vital part of ecosystems around the world. The fungi form symbiotic relationships with most land plants, forming intimate relationships with root systems in which they trade water and nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus for carbon that they use to grow farther out, expanding the highway delivering nourishment to the plant. It\u8217\'20\'19s a useful system anywhere, but especially in arid deserts like that in Saguaro National Park, where the land can be unforgiving. And the relationship\u8217\'20\'19s benefits spread far beyond deserts, forests and grasslands, as the fungi sequester over 13 billion tons of carbon that could otherwise be warming the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But despite their importance, how mycorrhizal fungi interact in various environments remains largely understudied, particularly in arid regions, where \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is threatening those systems.\par \par \uc2 Stewart, an ecologist, and Elhance, a data scientist, are with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.spun.earth/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN)}}}\uc2 , an organization founded to map mycorrhizal fungi networks. The two arrived in Tucson in mid-March to learn what fungi support saguaros and how they help the cacti remain resilient to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and the rapid spread of invasive species.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople think we know stuff about these really well-densely populated ecosystems,\u8221\'20\'1D Stewart said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s actually one of the least-sampled places on Earth.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 On the east side of Saguaro National Park, Stewart exited their vehicle, grabbed a rubber mallet, metal cylinder, test tubes and measuring tapes, and walked out into the desert toward an old saguaro with 16 limbs towering above the others.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHow did you evolve!,\u8221\'20\'1D Stewart yelled at the cactus, then proceeded to get to work. He knelt at the base of the saguaro and collected a core sample by pounding a cylinder into the ground with the mallet, then placed the brown soil into a bag to be sent to a lab for analysis, stopping only to taste the soil. \u8220\'20\'1CThis one doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have much flavor,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut sometimes they taste crazy.\u8221\'20\'1D Ten meters away from the saguaro, Stewart collected another sample to see how the mycorrhizal fungi networks in the soil differ farther from the cactus.\par \par \uc2 All the while, Elhance circled the saguaro, phone in hand, shooting a laser at it. It\u8217\'20\'19s nothing like Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, they explained, just LiDAR to create a 3D image showing how tall the cactus is and how many limbs it features, allowing the researchers to estimate its age.\par \par \uc2 Across the national park, the two collected samples around saguaros of all ages, from young ones just a few feet tall (though still decades old) to ones that have been growing for well over a century and rise 50 feet high.\par \par \uc2 Towering size and unique limbs have made saguaros icons of the American West, even though they are only native to Arizona and northern Mexico. The cacti\u8217\'20\'19s importance to the Sonoran desert goes far beyond their looks. Their fruit sustained generations of Indigenous communities across the Sonoran Desert. The Tohono O\u8217\'20\'19odham see saguaros as people, and in 2021, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ecojurisprudence.org/initiatives/tohono-oodham-legislative-council-resolution-affirming-personhood-of-hasan-saguaros-cacti/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tribe formally passed a resolution}}}\uc2  granting them legal personhood.\par \par \uc2 For the desert itself, they are a keystone species without which the ecosystem would collapse. More than 100 other species rely on saguaros for survival. Gilded flickers and Gila woodpeckers make nests within the cactus, which other birds take over once they leave. Their flowers bloom in May and June, the driest time of year, when all the other vegetation has begun to brown, making them one of the few reliable sources of food for insects and, in turn, other species up the food chain.\par \par \uc2 Like most species of the desert, saguaros grow at a leisurely pace. They take around 35 years to even begin flowering, decades longer to grow out their iconic arms, and more than 100 years to reach adulthood. The centuries-long lifespan makes the species resilient to changes to its \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is throwing a wrench into their survival. Higher temperatures, drier landscapes, bigger and hotter wildfires and invasive species\u8212\'20\'14which can outcompete saguaros by growing quickly and fueling fires that can kill native vegetation\u8212\'20\'14have resulted in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10042023/saguaro-restoration-climate-change/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 deaths of thousands of saguaros in recent years}}}\uc2 . In some areas, the species is unlikely to recover without human intervention.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI get super excited about fungi that live with weird plants, because it just shows that, like life, you can\u8217\'20\'19t live alone.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Justin Stewart, Society for the Protection of Underground Networks\par \par \uc2 Recent research published in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.70217"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Global Change Biology}}}\uc2  found that increasingly frequent and sustained heat and drought events are causing more scorching of the tissue of saguaros and other cacti, resulting in \u8220\'20\'1Ca three-fold increase in mortality of giant cactus species across the region.\u8221\'20\'1D That may lead to \u8220\'20\'1Clandscape-wide impacts that could fundamentally reshape populations of these keystone species and the communities that depend on them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Saguaros are all about numbers. As a succulent, it pulls in resources when it can\u8212\'20\'14particularly during the wet monsoon seasons of the summer\u8212\'20\'14and then stores them for months or even years. Each of its fruits has a couple of hundred seeds and disperse billions of them across the landscape, but few grow into new saguaros. That hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been a hindrance to a species with such a long lifespan, but changing fire and drought patterns are making their infrequent reproduction a greater vulnerability.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou literally are really bad at being alive,\u8221\'20\'1D Stewart jokingly told the ungainly saguaro before him. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the fungi are helping. I get super excited about fungi that live with weird plants, because it just shows that, like life, you can\u8217\'20\'19t live alone. These plants aren\u8217\'20\'19t living without fungi.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But what exactly those fungi are\u8212\'20\'14and how important they are to saguaros\u8217\'20\'19 survival\u8212\'20\'14remains somewhat of a mystery. Mycorrhizal fungi are incredibly endemic, Stewart said, meaning ecosystems often have their own unique species. As the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  changes, the SPUN team hopes to determine just how important mycorrhizal fungi are to making the iconic cactus resilient to adversity\u8212\'20\'14and what lessons the resilient desert species can teach us in a hotter and drier world.\par \par \uc2 Researching that connection, however, is dependent on having healthy ecosystems where the connection between mycorrhizal fungi and saguaros can be studied and provide a baseline for research\u8212\'20\'14something national parks and other protected lands can provide in abundance, but are now {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10062025/national-monuments-rally-antiquities-act-anniversary/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 under threat from the Trump administration}}}\uc2  as protected areas are threatened with dismantling, layoffs and funding cuts. National parks are refuges for biodiversity, Stewart said, and there are increasingly fewer places like them in the world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COnce it\u8217\'20\'19s gone and deleted, it\u8217\'20\'19s gone,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe thing that upsets me is, if they\u8217\'20\'19re gone before we actually know what\u8217\'20\'19s there, we have no idea what we\u8217\'20\'19ve lost. That\u8217\'20\'19s an immeasurable loss to humanity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe More We Look, The More We See\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For years, mycorrhizal fungi were like a black box, understudied because they were hidden below ground.\par \par \uc2 In 1983, Nancy Johnson found her first reference to mycorrhizal fungi in a one-and-a-half-page summary in a textbook after she began her master\u8217\'20\'19s program in botany at the \uc2 University of Wisconsin\uc2 , Madison. She was interested in studying symbiosis and mutualism\u8212\'20\'14the former concerned with the interaction between two species, and the latter focused on when both species benefit from the symbiosis\u8212\'20\'14and the fungi piqued her interest. She checked out every book she could find on the subject and finished them in two weeks.\par \par \uc2 It was the beginning of what would become a life\u8217\'20\'19s work for Johnson, who is now a Regents professor at \uc2 Northern Arizona University\uc2  and on SPUN\u8217\'20\'19s scientific advisory council.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe more we look, the more we see,\u8221\'20\'1D she said of the fungi. Studies in the decades since Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s time in Wisconsin have revealed how vital a component they are in ecosystems. \u8220\'20\'1CWe can tell that the fungus underground connects unrelated plants to each other,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe fungus makes this huge network under the soil. And, it\u8217\'20\'19s pretty important. Every plant\u8217\'20\'19s got maybe a dozen different fungi in it, and they come and go throughout the season.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Over the years, researchers like Johnson have found that mycorrhizal fungi are nearly everywhere and in almost every ecosystem. For over 400 million years, they have shaped life on Earth. The fungi even predate plant roots.\par \par \uc2 There are four main types of mycorrhizal fungi\u8212\'20\'14arbuscular, ectomycorrhizal, ericoid and orchid-specific mycorrhizal fungi. Arbuscular is by far the most common, making up 70 percent of global plant biomass, but they do not grow mushrooms, and are rarely seen. So they draw far less attention\u8212\'20\'14of the total samples of mycorrhizal fungi eDNA, those collected in their natural \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , there are ten-fold fewer samples of arbuscular fungi.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a huge blind spot that\u8217\'20\'19s especially pronounced in places like the Sonoran Desert, despite the fact that about a third of the world\u8217\'20\'19s population lives in arid regions.\par \par \uc2 Studies, Johnson said, are often focused on areas near major research institutions, typically not found in the vicinity of deserts. That\u8217\'20\'19s left more arid regions understudied, she said. And, given they are found underground, mycorrhizal fungi are understudied everywhere.\par \par \uc2 But mycorrhizal fungi are most certainly in the desert, and perhaps especially crucial to plant life in the region. \u8220\'20\'1CWater is the most limiting resource by far\u8221\'20\'1D in the desert, Johnson said, making nutrients harder for plants to get by themselves. Mycorrhizal fungi can make up for that.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe threads that come out of the fungus are super, super thin, and so they can get into these tiny, tiny nooks and crannies and increase the surface area tremendously for the uptake of all kinds of things,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are mechanisms showing how they actually do help with water uptake in that physical way and actually, they improve drought tolerance.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Threats to Public Lands Also Undercut Research\par \par \uc2 Living underground with few sprouting mushrooms made mycorrhizal fungi difficult to study. But modern technology has finally provided the tools to truly measure them at scale, researchers said, paving the way to understand how they work with plants and bacteria, and in turn, whole ecosystems.\par \par \uc2 But studying the fungi requires those ecosystems to be intact, with soil that has not been disturbed, which is increasingly rare in the modern world. That\u8217\'20\'19s made protected areas like national parks vital for that work.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s irreplaceable, undisturbed ecosystems where the soil has not been disturbed, the vegetation, it is preserved as a whole ecosystem,\u8221\'20\'1D said Johnson. \u8220\'20\'1CThose are super important.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration, however, has put those areas at risk, all while attacking science.\par \par \uc2 In February, the \uc2 National Park Service\uc2  fired 1,000 employees, only for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21032025/todays-climate-fired-national-parks-workers-reinstated/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 two U.S. District Court judges to order them reinstated}}}\uc2 , destabilizing parks across the country as they prepared for the busy summer season. The Trump administration\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Department of Government Efficiency\uc2  has slashed workforces at national parks, monuments, forests and other public lands. And federal funding freezes have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07032025/trump-federal-funding-freeze-stalls-arizona-conservation-work/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stalled vital \b  \highlight22conservation\b0 \highlight22  work}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now, Department of the Interior Secretary \uc2 Doug Burgum\uc2  has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.americanprogress.org/article/will-the-u-s-housing-crisis-be-exploited-for-a-massive-public-lands-sell-off/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 touted the idea of selling off public lands}}}\uc2  to address the nation\u8217\'20\'19s housing crisis. To that end, Republican members of the House of Representatives in May added a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15052025/nevada-utah-public-lands-housing-development/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 late-night amendment to the budget reconciliation bill to do exactly that in Nevada and Utah}}}\uc2 . Public outcry {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00021&segmentID=1"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 led to the amendment being stripped,}}}\uc2  but Republicans in the Senate are negotiating how to add public lands sales back into the bill.\par \par \uc2 Fewer workers can deteriorate visitors\u8217\'20\'19 experiences in national parks, but the impacts of staff cuts extend far beyond tourists. Researchers like the SPUN team and others rely on staff scientists at the park service to coordinate their visits, provide valuable resources on where to go for the best results, serve as conduits to existing studies that may be relevant to new work and point them towards other research projects in the park. Those staffers\u8217\'20\'19 departure will hinder research projects.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps most concerning, though, is direct threats to protected areas. Places like Saguaro National Park will likely stay protected, even if resources supporting those protections dwindle. But national monuments and some other public lands used for research may not remain protected.\par \par \uc2 In March, the Trump administration announced it would {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18032025/trump-administration-attacks-national-monuments-protests/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 eliminate California\u8217\'20\'19s Chuckwalla and S\u225\'00\'E1tt\u237\'00\'EDtla Highlands national monuments}}}\uc2  before removing language from a White House fact sheet publicizing the decision. The administration has also reported that it is considering shrinking six other monuments across the West. The Department of Justice in June issued an opinion saying {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11062025/doj-says-trump-has-power-to-eliminate-national-monuments/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the president has the power to undo national monuments}}}\uc2 , reversing the department\u8217\'20\'19s previous position and going against existing case law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt really is the heritage of our nation being preserved in these parks and short-sighted leaders and others just want to make a profit off of it,\u8221\'20\'1D Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 Grand Staircase-Escalante is one of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s largest national monuments, with 1.87 million acres of public land under the protection and management of the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2 . The first Trump administration shrank it by half, but the Biden administration quickly restored its size. The current Trump administration has signaled it may shrink that monument once again.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe current administration is really interested in coal production and energy production, and there\u8217\'20\'19s a really gigantic nine billion ton coal deposit right in the central part [of the monument] because it used to be a big swamp,\u8221\'20\'1D said Jackie Grant, the executive director of Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, which was founded in 2004 to protect and preserve the national monument. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s why it\u8217\'20\'19s so scientifically valuable, because there are amazing dinosaur and other fossil discoveries on the monument because of this historic swampiness.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Before her role at Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, Grant spent almost 13 years at \uc2 Southern Utah University\uc2 , where she first became acquainted with the monument when she took students there for research projects every summer. She studied bees and native plants, and collected native seeds for the BLM to aid in restoration projects, like wildfire recovery efforts.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen we\u8217\'20\'19re looking at the migration of the animals from \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, we need to look at landscape-scale movement of those animals,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CSo when we have 1.87 million acres under a single jurisdiction, that\u8217\'20\'19s going to be really helpful for designing studies related to \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and looking at how animals and plants change over time in response to a changing \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Research efforts often go far beyond just biology, she added, with Grand Staircase-Escalante and other parks and monuments providing study opportunities for both sociological and archeological studies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COne of my biggest points of fostering science on public lands is that public land science is often an incubator for applied science,\u8221\'20\'1D Grant said. Unlike research conducted in a lab, she said, research on public lands can support the actual restoration and management of the areas where the studies are conducted.\par \par \uc2 A Shifting Landscape\par \par \uc2 At the western end of Saguaro National Park near the edge of Tucson, Stewart and Elhance descended again into a field of saguaros.\par \par \uc2 Rather than collect soil at the base of a saguaro to analyze what fungi grow with it, this time they measured out rectangles on the land with their tape measure to take bulk samples, the equivalent of a census of the general biodiversity of the area, they said.\par \par \uc2 SPUN was founded not just to raise awareness of mycorrhizal fungi, but to map those fungal networks around the world in its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.spun.earth/articles/ground-truthing-process"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ground Truthing project}}}\uc2 . Researchers with SPUN like Elhance and Stewart take samples at understudied locations like Saguaro National Park, and then use machine learning to summarize how many species of the fungi are found in an area.\par \par \uc2 The project has used DNA samples from ecosystems around the world, both taken at SPUN-supported projects and drawn from other research papers, and aggregates them into one big study.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of scientists are moving towards trying to be able to draw scientific conclusions at larger, regional, even global scales, interpolating the individual point data that scientists typically collect when they\u8217\'20\'19re doing environmental research into predictions across the landscape,\u8221\'20\'1D Elhance said.\par \par \uc2 As global warming expands arid regions around the world, it\u8217\'20\'19s vital to understand the role mycorrhizal fungi networks play in those areas, and how they make native vegetation more resilient in the face of the changing \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It\u8217\'20\'19s important the work not slow down, the SPUN team said, but the Trump administration\u8217\'20\'19s slashing of federal funding for research, attacks on universities and threats to protected areas nonetheless threaten to delay it.\par \par \uc2 While ecosystems have never been stagnant, Stewart said, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is increasing the degree and speed of the changes they are enduring, shifting the borders of biomes. So it is crucial to get these baseline studies that tell researchers what exists in native communities before the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  can transform them.\par \par \uc2 The Sonoran Desert is younger than other arid regions, which is what makes it much wetter and greener, and has given it its famed biodiversity.\par \par \uc2 But hotter temperatures and less rainfall threaten to change that. And highly flammable invasive plants like buffelgrass and fountain grass, introduced for cattle grazing and landscaping. are fueling bigger and hotter wildfires in an ecosystem not adapted for them, killing saguaros that are tolerant of less-intense fires and speeding the spread of the combustible exotics.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://biology.ucdavis.edu/news/fighting-fire-fungi"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wildfires}}}\uc2  impact fungal networks, too, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935123010216"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 studies have found}}}\uc2 . But {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.16369"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 researchers have}}}\uc2  determined that if plants have their native mycorrhizal fungi systems in the soil, the networks can help negate some of the negative impacts of a changing \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The fungi help anchor those native species thanks to their interplay with a plant\u8217\'20\'19s root systems. That anchoring, Stewart said, may prove to be vital as the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  shifts.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is such a unique desert because it really changes shape. It\u8217\'20\'19s like a blob. Every year, the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  changes a little bit, so it expands or contracts a tiny amount,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CSo if you think of these fungi as things that stabilize plant communities, can they help make sure that these deserts don\u8217\'20\'19t grow or contract?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document LOST000020250622el6m00001\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc53}{\*\bkmkend toc53}\b \uc2 How 'Jaws' helped spark ocean  \highlight22\uc2 conservation \highlight\b0\par\par\uc2 By Wendy Benchley, Opinion contributor \par \uc2 540 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2025\par \uc2 Asheville Citizen-Times\par \uc2 ASHC\par \uc2 1; ACT\par D6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright Gannett 2025 All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When my late husband, Peter Benchley, and I celebrated our 40th anniversary, I had one wish: to go cage diving with great white sharks. After decades of ocean expeditions together, I'd often been the last one in the water \u8722\'22\'12 if I made it in at all. This time, I wanted to come face-to-face with the animals we now know are critical to ocean health.\par \par \uc2 June 20 marks the 50th anniversary of when "Jaws" \u8722\'22\'12 the blockbuster film based on Peter's bestselling novel \u8722\'22\'12 first hit the big screen. What began as a fictional thriller about a coastal town became a cultural phenomenon. It thrilled audiences. It scared them, too.\par \par \uc2 But it also sparked something else: fascination and wonder.\par \par \uc2 In the years after "Jaws," Peter received thousands of letters from people all over the world. Students, teachers, divers and future marine biologists \u8722\'22\'12 they were all curious about sharks and the ocean. Many wanted to be like Matt Hooper, the young ichthyologist played by Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.\par \par \uc2 This curiosity opened the door for shark and ocean \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  research, which has transformed our understanding. We joined scientists on expeditions and saw the damage firsthand: shark finning, plastic pollution, dying reefs.\par \par \uc2 We have learned that more than 100million sharks are killed each year to keep up with demand for shark fin soup in China and across Asia. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of conservationists and powerful public awareness campaigns, demand for shark fins has declined.\par \par \uc2 It is almost quaint that in the 1970s, people considered sharks our greatest ocean threat. Today, the ocean faces many urgent challenges. \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. Overfishing. Illegal and unregulated fishing. Deep-sea mining. Plastics. Offshore drilling. Warming and acidifying oceans. These aren't science fiction \u8722\'22\'12 they're happening now.\par \par \uc2 This National Ocean Month, I hope scientists, activists, policymakers, legislators and state, local and federal leaders \u8722\'22\'12 and ocean lovers everywhere \u8722\'22\'12 will join this year's Peter Benchley Ocean Award winners and step up to support legislation to protect marine areas.\par \par \uc2 Say no to expanded offshore drilling. Defend special places like sanctuaries and monuments. Choose sustainable seafood. Donate to \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  organizations. Volunteer for a beach cleanup. Visit your local aquarium and learn what's at stake.\par \par \uc2 We still have much\par \par \uc2 to learn about our oceans\par \par \uc2 The ocean covers about 71% of our planet, yet we've explored only a tiny fraction of it. The vast majority of this enormous blue underworld is yet to be revealed.\par \par \uc2 Each year, scientists discover new species \u8722\'22\'12 recently, a new species of guitar shark, for example. We could lose the opportunity to make such discoveries if we don't act quickly.\par \par \uc2 As police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) famously said in "Jaws," "We're gonna need a bigger boat."\par \par \uc2 "Jaws" brought sharks and the ocean into the public imagination. Let's use this moment to protect it.\par \par \uc2 We need all hands, working together, to fend off interests that would use the ocean to extract resources, threaten biodiversity and sacrifice cherished marine life.\par \par \uc2 Wendy Benchley is cofounder of the Peter Benchley Ocean Awards, serves on the boards of \uc2 WildAid\uc2  and Blue Frontier and is an advisory trustee for the \uc2 Environmental Defense Fund\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document ASHC000020250622el6m0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw233\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3495\pichgoal600

Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited \par \par \uc2 In 1974, the \u8216\'20\'18black magic\u8217\'20\'19 of Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen horrified its audience \u8211\'20\'13 but left an extraordinary impression on director Danny Boyle\par \par \uc2 Landing in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/bbc/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 BBC One}}}\uc2  schedules one Thursday evening in March 1974, Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen sat oddly. For those viewers who had earlier watched Tony Blackburn host Top of the Pops, or caught up with Are You Being Served? here was a completely different beast. It was peculiar \u8211\'20\'13 even by the standards of the channel\u8217\'20\'19s prestigious Play for Today slot, within which it sat. After all, the film set up a battle between the forces of Light and Dark, individualism and conservatism, on the Malvern Hills \u8211\'20\'13 all played out through the eyes of a priggish adolescent.\par \par \uc2 Few who saw it would have gone to bed without its succession of extraordinary, terrifying visions haunting their dreams \u8211\'20\'13 visions which, if director {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/danny-boyle/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Danny Boyle}}}\uc2  is to be believed, \u8220\'20\'1Cleft an extraordinary impression on me\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 At the age of seventeen much of it went over his head but he knew that night it was an \u8220\'20\'1Cincredible film\u8221\'20\'1D and when he eventually moved into television in the late Eighties, its director Alan Clarke was the first person he contacted. Small wonder, too, that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/28-years-later-review-sequel-jodie-comer-ralph-fiennes/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Boyle\u8217\'20\'19s latest film, 28 Years Later}}}\uc2 , a zombie horror set in Northumberland, feels like a direct successor to the eerie rural imagery of Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen.\par \par \uc2 The film is the story of a vicar\u8217\'20\'19s son, Stephen Franklin (Spencer Banks), a hidebound teenager whose comfortable, complacent assumptions about his world crumble one by one. He is visited by demons and angels, meets the ghost of his idol Edward Elgar, sees a church aisle splitting to reveal a giant bottomless chasm, is spoken to by Jesus on the cross, and witnesses the arrival of the seventh-century King Penda \u8211\'20\'13 the last pagan king of Mercia.\par \par \uc2 Like a modern-day Piers Plowman, each visitor tells Franklin a truth that he must assimilate \u8211\'20\'13 and which shakes his conservative, little-Englander views. The film\u8217\'20\'19s cry of individualism and the radical spirit has reverberated for over 50 years. Long before \u8220\'20\'1CRooster\u8221\'20\'1D Byron, the whirling, maverick force at the heart of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/jez-butterworths-jerusalem-greatest-british-play-century/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jez Butterworth\u8217\'20\'19s Jerusalem}}}\uc2 , Penda Fen\u8217\'20\'19s found uncanny, romantic resistance in the depths of the British countryside.\par \par \uc2 This \u8220\'20\'1Cfilm for television\u8221\'20\'1D was created by playwright David Rudkin, who had built his reputation with Afore Night Come for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-shakespeare-company/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Royal Shakespeare Company}}}\uc2  in 1962. This set out his stall as a writer of dark power and originality, depicting fruit-pickers at an orchard descending into savagery after a helicopter sprays them with pesticide.\par \par \uc2 Rudkin himself resisted any connection to the then-burgeoning genre of \u8220\'20\'1Cfolk horror\u8221\'20\'1D. But today it\u8217\'20\'19s hard not to view Rudkin\u8217\'20\'19s obsession with England\u8217\'20\'19s deep past, elemental forces, and his environmental fears as being in the same lineage as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-wicker-man-true-story-murder-charles-walton/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Wicker Man}}}\uc2  (1973), John Bowen\u8217\'20\'19s 1970 film Robin Redbreast (known as \u8220\'20\'1CBritain\u8217\'20\'19s Rosemary\u8217\'20\'19s Baby\u8221\'20\'1D) and the occult fiction of Dennis Wheatley. It was the mood of the times. A queasy pastoralism \u8211\'20\'13 which looks ever more prescient in our era of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  fears \u8211\'20\'13 haunts Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen. Yet it is more than that: throughout the film, there\u8217\'20\'19s a constant sense that some religious, mystical force is about to erupt from the pregnant landscape.\par \par \uc2 The true miracle is that it was ever broadcast at all. By 1971, Rudkin was struggling to get his increasingly difficult work staged; he also felt abandoned by television. That summer, though, producer David Rose came calling. He had enjoyed success with the launch of the police drama Z-Cars in the 1960s and had recently moved to the BBC\u8217\'20\'19s Pebble Mill studios in Birmingham. He wanted to put on new stories and Rudkin was high on his list. Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen was commissioned a year later.\par \par \uc2 Rose, who went on to set up Film on Four, always regarded it as his proudest achievement. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s an extraordinary piece of work,\u8221\'20\'1D he told me. \u8220\'20\'1CMy mother never spoke to me about my programmes, but she was haunted for nights by Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Spencer Banks \u8211\'20\'13 who played the film\u8217\'20\'19s adolescent hero \u8211\'20\'13 was familiar to many viewers from the hugely successful children\u8217\'20\'19s sci-fi series Timeslip. But his step into peak-time \u8220\'20\'1Cserious\u8221\'20\'1D drama was challenging. When Banks first went up for the part of Stephen, he never saw a script during auditions. He remembers his father sat at the kitchen table, checking over the contract. \u8220\'20\'1COh, here\u8217\'20\'19s a clause you don\u8217\'20\'19t see very often,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe actor agrees to be set on fire.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It was daunting for an 18-year-old to communicate this otherworldly journey into adulthood and \u8211\'20\'13 as Dennis Potter put it in his review for the New Statesman \u8211\'20\'13 \u8220\'20\'1Cthe images of light and darkness warring in the young man\u8217\'20\'19s mind\u8221\'20\'1D. In early rehearsals, Banks recalls he was \u8220\'20\'1Cconfused and a little lost,\u8221\'20\'1D but in the end, \u8220\'20\'1CI quite simply put all my faith in the director, Alan Clarke. Which I think is the reason we got the result that we did.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In commissioning the drama, Rose put together a writer and director who were chalk and cheese. Alan Clarke cut his teeth at \uc2 ITV\uc2  but was now firmly part of the BBC drama department. Today, his reputation is built on the violent and gritty Scum and Made in Britain \u8211\'20\'13 which, in their concern with broken, brutish young men, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2025/03/16/at-last-a-tv-drama-so-good-it-made-me-grateful-for-life/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 prefigure shows like Adolescence}}}\uc2 . But Clarke\u8217\'20\'19s early work tended to be naturalistic, contemporary and not as focused on vicious young men. Such a down-to-earth style was at odds with Rudkin\u8217\'20\'19s poeticism. At their first meeting, Rudkin was told by the director that this was \u8220\'20\'1Ca heavy number. How many books do I have to read to understand this?\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CJust the one,\u8221\'20\'1D replied Rudkin, pointing to the script in his hand.\par \par \uc2 In the end, their two visions gelled. The film\u8217\'20\'19s fantastic imaginings have their power because they are presented as real, almost ordinary, which makes them all the more disturbing.\par \par \uc2 Achieving this pulsing otherness was the next challenge. The shoot \u8211\'20\'13 much of it done outdoors \u8211\'20\'13 was an enormous operation, and the weather was a constant challenge. Actor Ian Hogg, who played local firebrand playwright Arne \u8211\'20\'13 the man who sparks Stephen\u8217\'20\'19s turn towards pastoral deep England \u8211\'20\'13 remembers how \u8220\'20\'1Cit rained when it shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t almost always\u8221\'20\'1D. The director began to take it personally. One sodden day, he asked his production manager, \u8220\'20\'1CIf I strip to the waist and thrash about in the mud, do you think [God] will forgive me and send some sunshine?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The crew\u8217\'20\'19s base camp was Chaceley, a village near Tewkesbury whose population even today is just a little over a hundred. The rectory, which doubled as Stephen\u8217\'20\'19s childhood home, was the location for a number of scenes, including the visit of a demon. As Stephen tosses and turns in the throes of an erotic dream about a fellow schoolboy, a terrifying, gargoyle-like incubus kneels on top of Stephen as he sleeps.\par \par \uc2 In another scene straight from William Blake, an angel appears to Stephen on a riverbank. Make-up designer Jan Nethercot recalls having to create a convincing heavenly visitation. Painting the actor gold, there was a worry he would asphyxiate if they failed to leave a small part of the skin uncovered. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19d seen {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/goldfinger-perfect-james-bond-film-sean-connery/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Goldfinger}}}\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D she recalls. The marshland that day was misty. Jan\u8217\'20\'19s assistant, Penny Gough, remembers how the light caused a radiance on the paint: \u8220\'20\'1CThe gold from his wingtips went right up into the mist and it was spectacular.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A further unforgettable image is of a man in a dinner jacket and bow-tie, standing by a tree stump on a garden lawn, as he uses a meat cleaver to cut off the hands of children in front of their devout parents. It\u8217\'20\'19s a queer, disturbing comment on subjugation \u8211\'20\'13 and vividly traumatising. The scene is presented as some ghastly, jubilant ritual, the victims rejoicing in their missing limbs.\par \par \uc2 Filming the scene, Clarke\u8217\'20\'19s main worry was whether the BBC would allow a crew to put any child in this situation. Costume designer Joyce Hawkins promptly volunteered her daughter, who is herself now a television producer. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a wonder I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t personally traumatised,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Caroline Hawkins\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1COr maybe I was, who knows?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Almost five million people watched Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen on its first transmission. Callers to the duty log described it as \u8220\'20\'1Chorrific\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Capproaching black magic\u8221\'20\'1D. One said it was \u8220\'20\'1Cdiabolical\u8221\'20\'1D and promised they \u8220\'20\'1Cwill be writing to someone very important\u8221\'20\'1D, but hadn\u8217\'20\'19t decided who it would be.\par \par \uc2 Those making it knew that the film was special \u8211\'20\'13 but none would have expected it to become as deeply embedded in the public consciousness. What brought it back from obscurity was a repeat on Channel 4 in 1990, just two days before the director Clarke\u8217\'20\'19s death. A new generation taped it and, slowly, Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen entered the canon, leading to books, music, cinema screenings and even academic conferences. The film also left its mark on English filmmakers like Mark Jenkin (Enys Men) and Ben Wheatley (A Field in England). And, of course, Danny Boyle.\par \par \uc2 At the time, though, the film was too singular to get a common reaction. Like a message in a bottle, it went out into the world and, as with the most lasting works of art, connected to the present moment. It touches on education, defence, the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , paganism and English traditions \u8211\'20\'13 but also has characters who are non-binary. (Indeed, the film\u8217\'20\'19s climax sees Stephen proclaim to the Wiltshire downs: \u8220\'20\'1CMy race is mixed, my sex is mixed, I am woman and man\u8230\'20\'26 I am mud and flame!\u8221\'20\'1D)\par \par \uc2 Speaking last year, Rudkin recalled a postbag filled with correspondents who said they had \u8220\'20\'1Csome inner place it reached that nothing else had.\u8221\'20\'1D More than 50 years on, Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen continues to find viewers\u8217\'20\'19 souls \u8211\'20\'13 and shake them.\par \par \uc2 Penda\u8217\'20\'19s Fen: Scene by Scene by Ian Greaves is published by\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tenacrefilms.bigcartel.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  Ten Acre Films }}}\par \par \uc2 on June 23.

Steven Spielberg's blockbuster about a bloodthirsty great white terrorizing a beach town also stoked fear and fascination, exacting a toll on sharks.\par \par \uc2 After 450 million years of evolutionary history, shark populations are collapsing, and more than a third of shark species and their relatives face extinction. Now scientists are trying to use the lure of "Jaws" to advance shark \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts.\par \par \uc2 With the exception of surfers and fishermen, people "didn't think about sharks much" 50 years ago, said David Shiffman, a marine \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  biologist at \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2 . But after "Jaws" was released, many summer beachgoers began to worry about sharks, even though attacks on humans are rare. Last year, there were 28 confirmed unprovoked bites in the United States \u8212\'20\'14 and only 47 worldwide.\par \par \uc2 This excessive fear of sharks was termed the "Jaws effect" and helped fuel a surge in shark-fishing competitions \u8212\'20\'14 especially targeting white sharks.\par \par \uc2 The threat of overfishingAlthough sportfishing posed a threat to sharks, Shiffman said the most significant impact of "Jaws" was more indirect. When the film came out, industrial fishing was just beginning to ramp up, and the risks posed to shark populations by commercial fisheries have become clear over time.\par \par \uc2 "Unsustainable fishing practices are the single largest threat to marine biodiversity, including but not limited to sharks, more so than \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, more so than plastic pollution, more so than oil spills," Shiffman said.\par \par \uc2 Following the release of "Jaws," efforts to protect sharks lost traction. The lack of movement to curb indiscriminate fishing techniques or take specific action to prevent the targeting of sharks for their fins and meat led to sharp declines in global shark populations.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 100 million sharks are killed each year, according to studies, and the global number of oceanic sharks and rays has declined by 71 percent since 1970.\par \par \uc2 "We know over the last 50 years, in the period really since 'Jaws' came out, that shark populations worldwide have been absolutely smashed by fishing," said Colin Simpfendorfer, a shark fisheries researcher at \uc2 James Cook University\uc2  in Australia. "We didn't do a lot about it because a lot of people thought sharks were bad and getting rid of them was probably a good thing."\par \par \uc2 In 2022, Congress attempted to address the issue of shark finning \u8212\'20\'14 the practice of chopping the valuable fins off live sharks and dumping their bodies overboard. But banning finning in the United States has had little effect on the practice in international waters, especially in Asia, where the fins are prized as the main ingredient in shark fin soup.\par \par \uc2 Studies have shown that bans on finning have been largely unsuccessful as long as the sale of shark meat remains legal.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2  restricts the trade in shark fins, and the 2022 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora expanded protections for 97 shark species and further restricted the international shark trade, but effective enforcement remains a challenge.\par \par \uc2 Citizen-led efforts across the world have gained momentum, including the launch of the Asian Shark and Ray Alliance this year to drive \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  across the continent. An increase in dive tourism has also spurred protection efforts in Southeast Asian nations like the Maldives and Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Using 'Jaws' to help sharksFor endangered sharks, it's a race against time to gather information that might help save them. And while "Jaws" might have contributed to the harms of unsustainable fishing practices, researchers and conservationists are now attempting to use the film to further scientific understanding and influence public policy.\par \par \uc2 "It created a fascination with sharks, and people began to realize we don't know that much about them, and a huge amount of research has happened on sharks and exploration of their lives in the last 50 years," said Steve Palumbi, a marine biologist at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Wendy Benchley, a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  advocate and widow of author Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel on which "Jaws" is based, said the enthusiasm generated by the film has been a powerful tool.\par \par \uc2 "Thousands of people around the world wrote letters to Peter saying, 'Oh I'm just riveted by sharks, I can't wait to learn more,' " Benchley said. " 'Jaws' has, and I have, been working on this for 50 years. So this moment is important because people are concentrating on sharks and on 'Jaws.' "\par \par \uc2 This interest has driven scientific advances that enabled researchers to study sharks' responses to pollution, stress and environmental change. The key to that research can be found in sharks' jaws: their teeth.\par \par \uc2 Shark teeth, which are replaced every few weeks, can number in the thousands over a shark's lifetime. The chemical makeup of the teeth can reveal information about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  the sharks lived in. And increasingly, their accumulation \u8212\'20\'14 or absence \u8212\'20\'14 is helping track how human activity has reshaped ocean life.\par \par \uc2 "There's been some really interesting work to reconstruct the population of sharks to understand exactly when human populations start to really affect sharks, and how dramatic that effect has been," Simpfendorfer said.\par \par \uc2 Preserving apex predatorsRecent studies have also confirmed sharks' importance to maintaining coastal food ecosystems, with significant human implications.\par \par \uc2 "Understanding the role they play in ecosystems is a powerful argument for understanding why we should protect them," Shiffman said. "We want healthy food chains off our coasts because they provide billions of humans with food and tens of millions of humans with jobs. And to have a healthy food chain, you need a healthy top of the food chain."\par \par \uc2 Yet as shark populations hurtle toward extinction, the perception issue persists.\par \par \uc2 Other apex predators such as tigers, polar bears and lions have benefited from forceful worldwide \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  campaigns that have translated into legal protections. But sharks haven't received the same degree of attention.\par \par \uc2 "Jaws" has already given white sharks a much-needed boost, and conservationists are hoping this will translate to other species.\par \par \uc2 "Great white sharks are actually one of the best studied and best protected species of sharks, and that is in no small part because of the fascination from 'Jaws,' " Shiffman said. "There are many other species that are doing much, much worse. There are many shark species that don't have five scientific papers about them."\par \par \uc2 In the United States, some researchers are noticing a greater harmony between the public and sharks.\par \par \uc2 "Over the last five to eight years, more and more sharks have been hanging around the beaches of Cape Cod," Palumbi said. "It's led to more people realizing that they have to give way, that they have to share space with white sharks, and that means moving someplace else to swim, not going to places that the white sharks are hunting."\par \par \uc2 John Baker, president and chief program officer at \uc2 WildAid\uc2 , a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  group, is hoping this trend will continue.\par \par \uc2 "With the spotlight back on 'Jaws' after 50 years, we kind of need to elevate the image of sharks as the 'polar bear of the ocean,' " Baker said.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020250620el6k000jm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

These prestigious accolades highlight the brand's innovation and creative excellence in brand storytelling.\par \par \uc2 Winning four awards, including the Grand Prix, at the prestigious Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is a testament to \uc2 Hyundai Motor\uc2 's consistent efforts to build an innovative brand identity through creative storytelling. It also reflects the global resonance of our content marketing approach. We will continue to explore distinctive ways to engage with customers across the evolving media and market landscape.\par \par \uc2 'Night Fishing' wins Grand Prix in the Entertainment - Branded Content category\par \par \uc2 'Night Fishing,' a bite-sized thriller or 'snack movie', was awarded the Grand Prix in the Entertainment - Branded Content category. Its recognition marks a rare achievement for a Korean automotive brand, highlighting the campaign's creativity and engaging storytelling on the global stage. This represents \uc2 Hyundai Motor\uc2 's first-ever Grand Prix win at the Cannes Lions Festival.\par \par \uc2 'Night Fishing' is a collaborative film by \uc2 Innocean\uc2 , a global brand communications company, director Moon Byounggon and famous Korean actor Son Sukku. The film breaks away from traditional advertising by offering a cinematic narrative free of explicit promotional elements. Filmed entirely from the viewpoints of seven fixed cameras on a car, this project establishes \uc2 Hyundai Motor\uc2  as a pioneer in brand storytelling.\par \par \uc2 Beyond its creative execution, the campaign made a real cultural impact, capturing attention not only as an outstanding piece of branded content but also as a conversation-driving work that challenged the boundaries of how brands can engage with culture.\par \par \uc2 I'm delighted that 'Night Fishing', our collaborative campaign with \uc2 Hyundai Motor\uc2 's Brand Marketing Division, demonstrated the power of authentic content to build meaningful connections between the brand and its consumers. It's even more rewarding to see that this resonated on a global stage and led to the honor of receiving the Grand Prix. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of audiences and cheer for this new format of film - 'snack movie'.\par \par \uc2 Yongwoo Lee CEO of \uc2 Innocean\par \par \uc2 I'm truly honored and thrilled to receive the Grand Prix at the world's most prestigious advertising festival, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the 'IONIQ Forest' program, and in July, it will reach the milestone of planting a million trees across 13 regions worldwide.\par \par \uc2 By combining AI technology with storytelling, 'Tree Correspondents' shifts the perspective to let trees tell their own stories about the importance of forest \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and creates a new kind of engagement around \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  impact. Unlike conventional AI-driven marketing, it maximizes the core strengths of AI, such as data analysis, summarization, and natural language generation (NLG), in a creative way rather than diminishing the role of human creators or serving merely as a marketing tool.\par \par \uc2 'Tree Correspondents' wins two Gold Lions and one Silver Lion in the Digital Craft category at Cannes Lions\par \par \uc2 'Tree Correspondents' wins two Gold Lions and one Silver Lion in the Digital Craft category at Cannes Lions 2.1 MB\par \par \uc2 Tree Correspondents' wins two Gold Lions at Cannes Lions\par \par \uc2 'Tree Correspondents' wins two Gold Lions and one Silver Lion in the Digital Craft category\par \par \uc2 In addition to the accolades, \uc2 Hyundai Motor\uc2  will further distinguish itself with participation in an exclusive, invitation-only Cannes Stage session, highlighting the company's influential presence in the global creative arena while spotlighting 'Night Fishing' as breakthrough branded content.\par \par \uc2 Since its June 2024 debut, 'Night Fishing' has received numerous accolades at esteemed festivals.

Multimedia Investments Ltd.  All rights reserved. \par \par \uc2 Source: People\u8217\'20\'19s Republic of China - State Council News\par \par \uc2 Wang Changtian, chairman of Beijing Enlight Media, addressed the success of his company\u8217\'20\'19s animated juggernaut "Ne Zha 2" and broader industry development during the SIFForum opening session at the 27th Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF) where the media executive joined fellow filmmakers and industry leaders for a panel discussion in Shanghai on June 15.\par \par \uc2 Wang Changtian, chairman of Beijing Enlight Media, speaks at the opening forum of the 27th Shanghai International Film Festival in Shanghai, June 15, 2025. [Photo courtesy of SIFF Organizing Committee]\par \par \uc2 "\u8216\'20\'18Ne Zha 2\u8217\'20\'19 represents an inevitable product of China\u8217\'20\'19s film industry at its current developmental stage," Wang said. "Yet it remains an exceptional case \u8212\'20\'14 not a replicable model with broad promotional or referential value. Unless we reform the underlying mechanisms and systemic issues, China\u8217\'20\'19s film sector may prove incapable of weathering the current challenges."\par \par \uc2 Wang argued the industry must overhaul its approach to genres, storytelling, style and audiovisual execution to improve films\u8217\'20\'19 competitiveness. "We\u8217\'20\'19re making too many unwanted films that can\u8217\'20\'19t compete with other entertainment," he said. He advocates cutting the annual output to 500-600 films \u8212\'20\'14 half of China\u8217\'20\'19s peak of 1,000 features \u8212\'20\'14 while focusing on boosting quality.\par \par \uc2 The executive highlighted the film industry\u8217\'20\'19s critical challenge of rapidly rising production costs outpacing market capacity, and called for urgent reforms in funding allocation. Wang emphasized the unsustainable risk burden on producers, with annual industry losses exceeding 10 billion yuan which has caused frequent production funding shortages. He stressed the necessity of both cutting costs and addressing profit redistribution to sustain the sector.\par \par \uc2 "Currently, from every 100 yuan in total box office revenue, only about 33 yuan remains for investors and creators after accounting for theater profit shares, fees and marketing expenses," he noted. "How can we sustain industry investment with such marginal returns?"\par \par \uc2 Wang proposed repositioning the role of films in the industrial chain by reducing box office revenue\u8217\'20\'19s share in total income. China\u8217\'20\'19s film industry currently depends on box office sales for over 90% of its revenue \u8212\'20\'14 far higher than the 30% seen in foreign markets \u8212\'20\'14 making losses inevitable when movies underperform. Wang believes reducing reliance to 50% would be more sustainable, and can be achieved by strengthening films as intellectual property drivers and increasing merchandise revenue.\par \par \uc2 Merchandise related to the "Ne Zha" film franchise clearly demonstrates this potential. Wang estimated licensed products have already generated tens of billions of yuan in sales. "Even with widespread piracy," he noted, "I believe ultimate derivative sales could realistically reach 100 billion yuan."\par \par \uc2 "Chinese films going global represents both an inevitable choice and an unstoppable trend," he added. "This aligns perfectly with Chinese products and services expanding their global market presence. As international consumers embrace Chinese goods, their growing interest in the culture behind these products naturally creates opportunities for Chinese cinema overseas. For \u8216\'20\'18Ne Zha 2,\u8217\'20\'19 we anticipate final international box office receipts will exceed $100 million. While this figure may seem modest, it already stands as the highest in 20 years. Conservative estimates indicate the film\u8217\'20\'19s total economic impact may surpass 200 billion yuan."\par \par \uc2 "Ne Zha 2" has already grossed $2.19 billion at the box office worldwide, and is the highest-grossing Chinese film, highest-grossing global animated film and the fifth-highest grossing film of all time in the world.\par \par \uc2 Film executives pose for a picture at the opening forum of the 27th Shanghai International Film Festival in Shanghai, June 15, 2025. [Photo courtesy of SIFF Organizing Committee]\par \par \uc2 Chen Zhixi, chairwoman and president of Wanda Cinemas, emphasized the need for industry realignment: "\uc2 Disney\uc2  and \uc2 Universal\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s 2024 reports reveal a balanced 40-60 revenue split between box office and non-theatrical income. We must restore this healthy equilibrium across both cinema operations and individual film economics through strategic expansion of non-ticket revenue streams."\par \par \uc2 She added that China now leads globally with over 80,000 cinema screens yet faces a growing shortage of high-quality content. Rising directors increasingly pursue ambitious projects requiring larger budgets and longer production cycles, reducing overall output. To address this, \uc2 Wanda Film\uc2  launched a filmmaker support program to help young directors. During the festival, \uc2 Wanda Film\uc2  also announced its rebranding as "Rtime" and released plans to develop a super entertainment space strategy integrating various entertainment options.\par \par \uc2 Veteran filmmaker Huang Jianxin acknowledged the new generation\u8217\'20\'19s talent while noting their growing box office anxieties in today\u8217\'20\'19s challenging \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . He emphasized the need for a crucial support system to alleviate financial pressures, allowing directors to focus entirely on crafting imaginative, expressive and compelling works. "Producers must help shoulder these burdens \u8212\'20\'14 directors aren\u8217\'20\'19t economists or marketers. Their power lies in imagination and artistic vision to unleash cinema\u8217\'20\'19s magic," Huang stressed.\par \par \uc2 Li Jie, president of Damai Entertainment, emphasized innovation as the proven solution to industry challenges. The current market slowdown, he noted, ironically creates an ideal window for creative breakthroughs. "Boom periods chain us to box office demands, leaving no space for creativity," he said. "Today\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  instead encourages patience and innovation across all aspects of filmmaking. Cinema must not be an outdated format, it has to go beyond, and to reclaim young audiences \u8212\'20\'14 and innovation is how we\u8217\'20\'19ll achieve this."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://milnz.co.nz/mil-osi-aggregation/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MIL OSI China News}}}\uc2  -\par \par \uc2 Document PARALL0020250619el6j0015v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw283\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4245\pichgoal600

Turns out, one species, clown anemonefish (Amphiprion percula), popularized in the Pixar hit movie Finding Nemo, have yet another surprising survival trick up their fins: they can also shrink themselves to weather heat waves and dodge social squabbles. When things get hot and tense on the reef, these little fish size down to stay alive and keep the peace, a new study finds.\par \par \uc2 Published this May in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Science Advances}}}\uc2 , the study reveals a fascinating finding: these clownfish can actually get shorter \u8212\'20\'14 not just skinnier \u8212\'20\'14 to survive extreme heat. And this shrinking strategy boosts their odds of making it through a heat wave by up to 78%.\par \par \uc2 Melissa Versteeg, the study\u8217\'20\'19s lead author and a doctoral researcher at \uc2 Newcastle University\uc2  in the U.K., said the shrinking in length was the most surprising finding. \u8220\'20\'1CThat wasn\u8217\'20\'19t anything we\u8217\'20\'19d witnessed before,\u8221\'20\'1D she told Mongabay by email. She said she was also struck by how shrinking helped the fish survive heat stress. And then they \u8220\'20\'1Calso bounce back when they can.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To dive into this curious survival strategy, the research team, working with the Mahonia Na Dari \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and Research Centre in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, observed 67 breeding pairs of wild clown anemonefish from February to August 2023. This study period overlapped with the world\u8217\'20\'19s fourth global coral bleaching event, during which local water temperatures surged as much as 4\u176\'00\'B0 Celsius (7.2\u176\'00\'B0 Fahrenheit) above the long-term average.\par \par \uc2 The researchers monitored breeding pairs every four to six days to track survival and anemone-scale heat stress, while measuring each fish\u8217\'20\'19s total length at the start and end of every lunar month. To their surprise, 100 out of 134 fish shrank during the study, so much so that they re-measured each fish multiple times over five months to confirm it. In the end, Versteeg said, shrinking proved to be very common in this population.\par \par \uc2 \u8206\'20\'0E\u8221\'20\'1DShrinking to survive seemed at odds with what we know, as being of larger size is typically favourable to e.g. reproductive success,\u8221\'20\'1D Versteeg added.\par \par \uc2 Scientists aren\u8217\'20\'19t exactly sure how clownfish shrink. Nor are they certain what advantage they gain from doing so, but the researchers suggest it could help the fish reduce their metabolic demands when heat ramps up and oxygen becomes scarce. Smaller bodies may also be easier to maintain when food is limited or harder to find during a heat wave.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/16062254/Kimbe-Bay.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Image by Morgan Bennett-Smith.}}}\par \par \uc2 Shrinking, staying together\par \par \uc2 Clown anemonefish live in tight-knit reef groups across the Indo-Pacific, where marine heat waves are getting hotter and more frequent. They live symbiotically with anemone (Radianthus magnifica), with a single anemone hosting a group that maintains a strict size-based hierarchy: a dominant breeding pair \u8212\'20\'14 a larger female (rank 1) and slightly smaller male (rank 2) \u8212\'20\'14 followed by three to six nonbreeding subordinates. Dominants grow to match the anemone\u8217\'20\'19s size and its available resources, while subordinates stay small to avoid eviction \u8212\'20\'14 a death sentence in the wild. This study zoomed in on these dominant pairs, whose clear size ranks make them perfect for tracking survival tactics.\par \par \uc2 Even more intriguing? The fish that shrink together, survive together. The study found clownfish had a better shot at making it through a heat wave if they shrank in sync with their breeding partner. It\u8217\'20\'19s the first time scientists have seen a reef fish respond to both environmental and social pressures by actually changing its size.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFinding this ability for shrinking improved the survival of the clown anemonefish was super surprising,\u8221\'20\'1D Versteeg said, because \u8220\'20\'1Cclown anemonefish live in strict social formations where size is also key \u8212\'20\'14 getting smaller is risky because competition over social positions in the group can lead to eviction from the anemone.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Once they saw that shrinking happened within breeding pairs, it started to make more sense, Versteeg said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe saw that subdominant males would shrink a little more compared to the dominant females, presumably to uphold the size hierarchy and avoid conflict.\u8221\'20\'1D Meanwhile, females only shrank if their size compared to their male partner allowed it safely, meaning they still had to be big enough to avoid conflict, she added.\par \par \uc2 Fabio Cortesi, a clownfish expert at \uc2 the University of Queensland\uc2  in Australia, who wasn\u8217\'20\'19t involved in the research, praised the study\u8217\'20\'19s rigor and fieldwork intensity, calling it \u8220\'20\'1Can enormous amount of work\u8221\'20\'1D amid \u8220\'20\'1Can extreme marine heating event.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CVersteeg and colleagues did an excellent job,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Mongabay by email\par \par \uc2 Cortesi said the study\u8217\'20\'19s unique setup \u8212\'20\'14 monitoring site-attached breeding pairs every few days \u8212\'20\'14 made for an ideal natural experiment. Similar shrinkage has been observed in a few other vertebrates, like Gal\u225\'00\'E1pagos marine iguanas during El Ni\u241\'00\'F1o and tree shrews in winter, but \u8220\'20\'1Cto see something similar occurring in the clownfish is fascinating and not something one would expect,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/12123127/20240623-1X5A4699-2.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Clown anemonefish have a surprising survival strategy: they shrink in length \u8212\'20\'14 not just lose weight \u8212\'20\'14 to survive marine heat waves and avoid social conflicts, boosting their heat wave survival odds by up to 78%, a new study finds.

Possibly, said co-author Theresa Rueger, a senior lecturer at \uc2 Newcastle University\uc2 , but she stressed that more research is needed to be sure.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf individual shrinking were widespread and happening among different species of fish, it could provide a plausible alternative hypothesis for why the size of many fish species is declining,\u8221\'20\'1D Rueger said in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084161"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 news release}}}\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CFurther studies are needed in this area.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Cortesi likewise said he believes the study opens up a host of other intriguing questions about how clownfish manage to shrink. \u8220\'20\'1CDo their bones get shorter or more compressed? Is it metabolic stress from excess heat or a result of food restriction?\u8221\'20\'1D he asked.\par \par \uc2 He also questioned just how common this shrink-to-survive strategy is in the marine world. \u8220\'20\'1CDo other fish also shrink and grow in response to temperature shifts \u8212\'20\'14 especially smaller, site-attached species?\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CCould this be a mechanism to deal with the rapid acceleration of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, where extreme fluctuations in temperature are becoming more and more common?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Answering these questions, Cortesi said, will require \u8220\'20\'1Can enquiring scientific mind and carefully, well-balanced and controlled experiments.\u8221\'20\'1D He recommended bringing the system back into the lab \u8212\'20\'14 inducing shrinkage under controlled temperature, social and feeding conditions, paired with physiological and molecular tests \u8212\'20\'14 to better understand what drives the change.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Versteeg said she hopes the study leaves readers not just amazed by the fish\u8217\'20\'19s resilience and the \u8220\'20\'1Cingenuity of nature against a backdrop of major \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis,\u8221\'20\'1D but inspired to take action.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf anemonefish can coordinate and adapt, surely we can too,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CI hope that the paper reminds us that there is so much yet to discover. I believe that we can collaborate to protect our ocean environments.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Banner image: Clown anemonefish live symbiotically with anemone, with a single anemone hosting a group that maintains a strict size-based hierarchy.

There, she listed to Matthew Bannister\u8217\'20\'19s podcast \u8220\'20\'1CFolk on Foot,\u8221\'20\'1D in which he meets folk musicians throughout the U.K., takes them on walks, discusses music, and then has them make music. One of the shows included Jackie Morris, the aforementioned illustrator of The Lost Words.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo I started reading it,\u8221\'20\'1D Papacek Harper tells \uc2 THR\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CAnd they did an online live festival to raise money for all the artists who couldn\u8217\'20\'19t work during lockdown. One of the things that they put up during the festival was Jackie Morris doing one of her live drawings of otters while doing an incantation from the book. I was on a really long walk through the countryside, and I just started bawling, because there was something about how all these things intersected within that moment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That was the first inspiration for the film, along with the basic idea that \u8220\'20\'1Cif you cannot name something, you cannot care for it,\u8221\'20\'1D she shares. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was really something much more tender that we are missing from a lot of the work we try to bring to people about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That is why the film mentions some shocking information about humans\u8217\'20\'19 impact on nature, but the filmmaker doesn\u8217\'20\'19t confront viewers with too much data. In her conversations with scientists, \u8220\'20\'1Cit was clear that there was a thirst for them to find new ways to bring their data to the public, because it\u8217\'20\'19s very clear that we\u8217\'20\'19ve gotten past the breaking point,\u8221\'20\'1D Papacek Harper explains. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve had the figures for a very long time, but how do we emotionally engage with the public so that they feel that they are tied into those figures? So I didn\u8217\'20\'19t want to overwhelm them with information about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In the end, you can feel that we\u8217\'20\'19re over-informed, but what we don\u8217\'20\'19t necessarily have is that empathetic engagement.\u8221\'20\'1D That\u8217\'20\'19s where she saw a key role for the film.\par \par \uc2 Her and fellow filmmakers strive \u8220\'20\'1Cto make empathetic tools in a world where empathy is decreasing daily,\u8221\'20\'1D Papacek Harper says, pointing out two forms of empathy. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s the immediate emotional empathy, and then there\u8217\'20\'19s cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy really demands that you engage with a subject,\u8221\'20\'1D she explains. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd to allow people to engage with the subject, it is important to rely on emotional connection and poetry touching them throughout the film.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The movie also acknowledges that there is a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis, but tries to avoid having viewers frozen with fear. \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to take into account the crisis. We can\u8217\'20\'19t put it aside, but I was looking for a way for us to step out of that space,\u8221\'20\'1D Papacek Harper says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt nourishes \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  anxiety, as opposed to putting people in a position from which they can act. So the film is geared towards the idea that by putting people in a place where they fear, but they also feel that they\u8217\'20\'19re in a connected space with the natural world and the human world, and with each other, they can act for the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  and with the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Music and sound play a key role in Lost for Words. Composer Leonie Floret and sound from Julie Marechal, Florian Vourlat, Kirstie Howell, Cassandra Rutledge, Heather Andrews, and Zo\u235\'00\'EB Irvine create a soundscape that often gives you the feeling of being in nature or brings you close to nature, thanks to music performed in it. \u8220\'20\'1CWe wanted to create this immersive sound that invites you into the landscape and gets you wrapped in,\u8221\'20\'1D Papacek Harper tells \uc2 THR\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One recurring element in Lost for Words is children discussing nature and its loss. \u8220\'20\'1CSome of the richest parts of the filming were spending time with the kids and realizing how much kids think about things that we don\u8217\'20\'19t expect them to be able to think about,\u8221\'20\'1D the filmmaker says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut if you give them a microphone, they have a lot to say, and they actually say some of the most touching things. I was going to see some scientists and researchers and artists with the expectation that they would have the really constructive thought process. But in the end, everyone comes to the same conclusion. It isn\u8217\'20\'19t rocket science. Connecting to actually work together for our future is a basic concept, and anyone can get it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Lost for Words\u8217\'20\'19 Courtesy of Hannah Papacek Harper\par \par \uc2 Papacek Harper is working on various new creative projects and ideas. \u8220\'20\'1CLike most community filmmakers, I am always working across projects, some geared towards the same sort of subject matter,\u8221\'20\'1D she tells \uc2 THR\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1COne of them is a film that I\u8217\'20\'19m doing with my mother, which is about hope, and it will be in the Scottish forest \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  project.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Another part of her work is geared towards looking at the sense of belonging in the world. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s more of a hybrid approach to cinema,\u8221\'20\'1D the filmmaker explains. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s about breaking away and trying to figure out a place in an over-connected world where we feel quite hopeless a lot of the time. A lot of the thought process behind what I do is about how we can have a feeling of agency. But also, what do we do with that power? There has to be a bit of humility in the mix.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lost-for-Words-Hannah-Papacek-Harper-H-2025.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 'Lost for Words' film still (Courtesy of Hannah Papacek Harper)}}}\par \par \uc2 Document HLYW000020250618el6i0002v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw268\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4020\pichgoal600

Set against the backdrop of a dramatically escalating environmental crisis, the film unfolds as Brazil grapples with the extractive industry and threats to Indigenous lands. YANUNI not only offers an intimate portrait of Juma Xipaia, an environmental warrior, mother and chief, but also illustrates a searing indictment of extractive industries, political inaction, and systemic neglect that continue to endanger the Amazon and the people who call it home.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the global significance of the Amazon and Juma's leadership, \uc2 Leonardo DiCaprio\uc2 , producer of YANUNI, said during his introduction speech at the festival, "Juma's resilience and clarity in this film underscore the urgency of protecting the Amazon. As a producer, I'm honoured to help bring this story to the world\u8212\'20\'14a story we can no longer ignore. The Amazon may feel distant, but its fate is deeply tied to us here at home. It regulates our \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , holds more biodiversity than anywhere on Earth, and sustains life far beyond its borders. Yet it survives only because of people like Juma, who refuse to let it disappear."\par \par \uc2 "YANUNI is a powerful reminder of how film can illuminate the courage of those fighting on the frontlines of environmental justice," says \uc2 Dax Dasilva\uc2 , Executive Producer of YANUNI and Founder of Age of Union. "Juma's bravery and unwavering commitment to protecting her people and the forest embody the kind of leadership the world needs. At Age of Union, we believe in storytelling to elevate voices like Juma's to honour their courage, share their knowledge, and inspire urgent action to safeguard our collective future. We are honoured to have played a part in this film and to have celebrated its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival."\par \par \uc2 Dasilva, who joined the project from its earliest stages as Executive Producer, has been a vocal supporter of Indigenous-led \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  movements through his non-profit organization Age of Union.

Running from 19-29 June 2025, the programme reflects the issues of now, through a smorgasbord of films that will get your endorphins going. You may even fall in love.\par \par \uc2 On the subject of love, let\u8217\'20\'19s talk about sex. Sex in books. Scandalous books by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1000359.A_Scandalous_Woman_and_Other_Stories"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Edna O\u8217\'20\'19Brien}}}\uc2 . Her first novel in 1960 was credited with breaking the silence on sexual matters and social issues during a repressive period in Ireland after the Second World War. The book was banned and denounced from the pulpit. The film, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://encounters.co.za/film/blue-road/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Blue Road,}}}\uc2  captures how O\u8217\'20\'19Brien makes her own way in the world towards a bold life.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEErqpfb3HM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Love and war have been an odd pair since the phrase \u8220\'20\'1Cmake love not war\u8221\'20\'1D was coined.\par \par \uc2 This year, the \u8220\'20\'1Cwar\u8221\'20\'1D films craftily look at what else happens during times of war. In Mr Nobody against Putin, a brave teacher ostensibly follows Putin\u8217\'20\'19s orders to re-educate Russian pupils about the war against Ukraine while putting his own life in danger.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUeDa8FK_8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 In {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://encounters.co.za/film/khartoum/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Khartoum}}}\uc2 , refugees fleeing from Sudan reclaim their stories of survival through powerful reenactment and multimedia expression, and the war story is rendered an artistic story told through character on green screens.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMytTsr2psM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 In Intercepted, the audience eavesdrops on calls from Russian soldiers made from the battlefields in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 And in Yalla Parkour, Gaza gets a different gaze, through the eyes of a young parkour athlete.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc03KEoFQTY"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 In {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://encounters.co.za/film/abo-zaabal-89/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Abo Zaabal 89}}}\uc2 , a son revisits the emotional weight of his parents\u8217\'20\'19 resistance in Egypt and the scars left by state brutality and silence. This is creative storytelling at its best.\par \par \uc2 The master crafter of documentaries, Wim Wenders, brings the monumental works of artist Anselm Kiefer to the 3-D screen in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye5YU9EaPKc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anselm}}}\uc2 , allowing the viewers to be present in Kiefer\u8217\'20\'19s prodigious studio where the 80-year-old artist continues to create visceral works. Kiefer is one of the most important artists of the last 50 years, building and breaking concrete, burning straw and liquifying lead. Sometimes he uses lead for his book sculptures. Derived from his interests in mythology, history and knowledge, Kiefer often uses books as subject matter representing knowledge and learning.\par \par \uc2 At least five of the programmed documentaries are about different ways of encountering learning and gaining knowledge: Mothers of Chibok; Fitting In; Shadow Scholars; Brief Tender Light; and How to Build a Library.\par \par \uc2 Incidentally, O\u8217\'20\'19Brien\u8217\'20\'19s last novel, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.faber.co.uk/product/9780571341184-girl/#:~:text=The%20final%20novel%20by%20the,author%20of%20The%20Country%20Girls.andtext=I%20was%20a%20girl%20once,seems%20entirely%20consumed%20by%20madness."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Girl}}}\uc2 , was a fictional account of a victim of the 2014 Chibok kidnapping in Nigeria. The mothers in the titular Mothers of Chibok were shattered by the kidnapping of their daughters by \uc2 Boko Haram\uc2 , a group resolutely against western education, yet their determination to put their other children through school was not broken. These mothers are so steadfast about the importance of education as a possible escape from poverty, that they work almost unworkable fields with crude hand tools for cash to pay school fees.\par \par \uc2 The layers of complexity for students to study outside their home countries is explored in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://encounters.co.za/film/brief-tender-light/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brief Tender Light}}}\uc2 . The filmmaker follows five students from different African countries while they study at MIT in the US (someone, please buy a ticket for President Trump \u8212\'20\'14 he may just learn a thing or two about foreign students at American universities.)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeyaCyoDe_8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view video}}}\par \par \uc2 Shadow Scholars turns on its head (please buy President Trump a ticket to this film too!) the awful trope of the \u8220\'20\'1Cstupid\u8221\'20\'1D African student and the \u8220\'20\'1Cbright\u8221\'20\'1D American student, with the laying open of an established business practice of unemployed graduates in Kenya writing papers, essays and dissertations for students at American universities. Yet, embedded in this thriving business, which sees the Kenyans receive a payment for their intellectual labour while the American students graduate with degrees not laboured for, are many layers of dishonesty, deceit and duplicitous ethics.\par \par \uc2 How to Build a Library is a beautiful film, which positions the main Nairobi public library as a place for learning about the country\u8217\'20\'19s colonial past, while exploring new opportunities for Kenyan graduates on home soil. And closer to home is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://encounters.co.za/film/fitting-in/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fitting In}}}\uc2 , a year in the life of the House Committee at Eendrag, a men\u8217\'20\'19s residence at Stellenbosch University. How these young men deal with the past to forge a future for all, is a film worth seeing.\par \par \uc2 Our collective future is dependent on \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, how we understand it and what we do about it.

The world seems to be getting more and more unhinged. Collective insanity and mindless tragedies leave me questioning everything.\par \par \uc2 "Unable to sleep, and woke up to this thought that giving up is not an option. We all have something we\u8217\'20\'19re meant to do, some way we\u8217\'20\'19re meant to play our part. The madness doesn\u8217\'20\'19t change that; if anything, it makes it more urgent. Sometimes the most radical act is simply doing your work sincerely."\par \par \uc2 The actress further said, "For now, my mission is to find the right producing partner for my next film and tell a story that I think needs to be told.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Release date - 16062025\par \par \uc2 A new film by \uc2 Samsung\uc2  and Seatrees captures the impact and urgency of coral reef restoration through the lens of Galaxy technology.\par \par \uc2 At the United Nations Ocean Conference 2025 (UNOC)1 in Nice, held to mark World Oceans Day on June 8, \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2  hosted a premiere event for 'Coral in Focus,' a new documentary that brings the global coral crisis into sharp relief. The event, held at Ocean House, featured a screening of the film followed by a panel discussion with leading voices in marine science, \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and technology.\par \par \uc2 Directed by award-winning filmmaker Quentin van den Bossche, 'Coral in Focus' follows scientists, engineers and local conservationists as they confront the urgent threats facing coral reefs - ecosystems that support up to a billion people and a quarter of all marine life. This work is part of a broader effort announced at Galaxy Unpacked in January 2025, where \uc2 Samsung\uc2  unveiled its partnership with Seatrees to support the restoration of coastal ecosystems with communities in Fiji, Indonesia and the United States, leveraging Galaxy camera technology to document and aid in the recovery of marine environments.\par \par \uc2 The documentary spotlights the urgent threats facing coral reefs and showcases how innovative technology and global collaboration can drive meaningful impact for marine ecosystems.\par \par \uc2 A Crisis Hidden Beneath the Surface\par \par \uc2 As ocean temperatures shattered records, more than 80% of the world's reefs have suffered from mass bleaching. When corals bleach, they lose not just their color but their lifeblood - the algae that feed them. This crisis, largely invisible to the public, threatens biodiversity, food security and coastal resilience. Long-term \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  action is crucial to safeguarding coral reefs, while short-term restoration efforts - informed and supported by innovative technology - can help them withstand rising ocean temperatures.\par \par \uc2 A Galaxy Smartphone That Sees Beneath the Waves\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  collaborated with Seatrees, a nonprofit dedicated to restoring marine ecosystems, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the \uc2 University of California, San Diego\uc2 , a global leader in reef research, to pioneer a new frontier in coral restoration by exploring new, innovative solutions. Ocean Mode,2 a specialized camera feature created specifically for this partnership, was developed, introduced and validated in real-world conditions in Indonesia and Fiji. This process has created a credible foundation for broader scientific use while improving the overall accessibility of this new technology.\par \par \uc2 By enabling more scientists, conservationists and even citizen scientists with the ability to photograph, map and monitor reefs, Ocean Mode can help restoration efforts scale, and make it possible for anyone to protect more reefs, in more places, with greater impact.\par \par \uc2 Innovation With Measurable Impact\par \par \uc2 Ocean Mode transforms the Galaxy S24 Ultra into a mobile marine research tool, enabling vivid, high-resolution image capture even in challenging underwater conditions. It corrects the excessive blue and green hues typical of underwater photography, allowing for a more accurate representation of coral health and diversity.\par \par \uc2 The camera adjusts shutter speed and leverages multi-frame image processing to reduce motion blur caused by water movement or diver activity, ensuring sharp, detailed images. With its interval shooting capability, the device can automatically capture thousands of images in a single dive, dramatically improving both efficiency and consistency. These images can then be used to generate 3D models of coral reefs using technology known as photogrammetry, giving researchers a powerful way to visualize and study the drivers of the structure and health of reefs over time.\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, the project has delivered extraordinary results. With these coral restoration initiatives, 17 3D models of coral reefs have been made with the help of scientists and \uc2 Samsung\uc2  to analyze the impact of coral restoration efforts and validate the precision of Galaxy devices for photogrammetry. In total, Seatrees project partners planted more than 14,046 coral fragments to restore 10,705 square meters of coral reef habitat.\par \par \uc2 A Premiere With Purpose\par \par \uc2 The 'Coral in Focus' premiere at Ocean House, in partnership with Project Everyone, brought together scientists, storytellers and \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  leaders for a powerful conversation on the role that technology and global collaboration play in the future of coral reefs.\par \par \uc2 ? (From left) Alex Heath, Cassie Smith, Dr. Daniel Wangpraseurt, Michael Stewart and Quentin van den Bossche\par \par \uc2 ? 'Ocean Mode became its own character in the documentary,' said Quentin van den Bossche, director of 'Coral in Focus.' 'This helped us illustrate some of the complex, specific challenges that reef conservationists encounter. And showing the difference between photos taken with and without Ocean Mode helped ground the technology in something visual and even emotional. This is where the impact of partnerships among companies, research institutes and nonprofits truly comes to life.'\par \par \uc2 ? Michael Stewart, co-founder of Seatrees, holds a Galaxy S24 Ultra to show Ocean Mode Year 1 impact metrics - about 14,046 coral fragments planted across three restoration sites.\par \par \uc2 'A key focus of the coral restoration efforts is being able to monitor what's working and what's not. And that starts with capturing high-quality images of our supported reefs,' said Michael Stewart, co-founder of Seatrees. 'Our local partners have really appreciated Ocean Mode because it has improved their ability to capture higher-quality images with Galaxy phones to make the 3D models created by the scientists at Scripps more accurate.'\par \par \uc2 'Mobile technology is a powerful way to connect communities with ecosystems they may never physically encounter but are deeply tied to through \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , biodiversity and cultural heritage,' said Daniel Wangpraseurt, Ph.D., associate research scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 'Smartphones are now capable of taking high-resolution imagery to help generate more accurate 3D models. They also hold unique potential to increase the pace at which we share this information with people around the world who may never get to experience a coral reef themselves.'\par \par \uc2 ? 'Through our partnership with Seatrees, we saw how Galaxy technology could play a role not just in responsible sourcing but in supporting coral reef restoration,' said Cassie Smith, Senior Manager, Corporate \b \highlight22\uc2 Sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  and U.S. Public Affairs at \uc2 Samsung Electronics America\uc2 . 'The documentary tells that story beautifully - showing what happens when like-minded partners, engineers, scientists and local communities come together with shared purpose and the right tools.'\par \par \uc2 ? Attendees of the 'Coral in Focus' documentary premiere included Swati Thiyagarajan, award-winning documentary filmmaker, environmental journalist with the Sea Change Project and associate producer and production manager of the Academy Award-winning 'My Octopus Teacher'; Titouan Bernicot, founder and CEO of Coral Gardeners and National Geographic Explorer; and Beverly Camhe, writer, producer and entertainment executive.\par \par \uc2 'It's essential for the private sector to be involved and help get impactful solutions off the ground,' said Lefteris Arapakis, co-founder of Enaleia. 'We need all parties working together to protect and scale ocean \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts.

Credit Susan Willis\par \par \uc2 The stunning beauty of the South West has inspired many writers and artists, but now \uc2 Natural England\uc2  has joined forces with a poet and film maker to create a series of six inspiring videos about nature on protected sites in this corner of the country.\par \par \uc2 Taking in protected sites across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, the films, called "Wild Westcountry Odyssey" are a result of a collaboration between \uc2 Natural England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Protected Site Strategies (PSS) Research and Development Programme and the [RENEW Biodiversity project] (https://renewbiodiversity.org.uk/) at the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2 . RENEW (Renewing biodiversity through a people in nature approach) is a collaboration between the\u8239\'20\'2FUniversity and the\u8239\'20\'2F\u8239\'20\'2F{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 National Trust}}}\uc2 , funded by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Natural \b  \highlight22Environment\b0 \highlight22  Research Council}}}\uc2 . It also partners with major \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  bodies like the \uc2 RSPB\uc2  and Wildlife Trusts.\par \par \uc2 The aim of future Protected Site Strategies will be to ensure the root causes of environmental issues - often driven by factors beyond the sites themselves - are addressed in ways that guarantee wildlife thrives on those sites, while helping nature recovery beyond their boundaries. All six of the Protected Sites chosen for the films are Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Habitat Sites.\par \par \uc2 Each film includes two short poems, specially written by John Wedgwood Clarke. The films celebrate the beauty and diversity of nature on the sites and the key achievements and projects that have restored habitats and species and are successfully tackling environmental change and impacts resulting from human activity\par \par \uc2 David Burton, \uc2 Natural England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Principal Officer for the Protected Site Strategies Implementation and Development programme, said:\par \par \uc2 We supported the production of the films to research how creative media can help re-set the relationships between people and nature within the framework of Protected Site Strategies. The approach is to educate and highlight the need for nature recovery to everyone.\par \par \uc2 Too often the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  sector has failed to communicate the plight of biodiversity in accessible, positive and thought-provoking ways. For Protected Site Strategies to realise the ambition we have set for them, resetting the relationships between nature and people in ways that build a resilient future for all, we need to harness the power of creative channels for our call to action.\par \par \uc2 John, Simon, and the rest of the \u8216\'20\'18Wild Westcountry Odyssey\u8217\'20\'19 team have created inspirational stories through film and poetry to help set our first few Protected Site Strategies on their way.\par \par \uc2 Simon Willis, filmmaker, said:\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s been a privilege to work with all the nature reserves and John. The human effort that goes into keeping them thriving for wildlife is remarkable.\par \par \uc2 I hope our images and John\u8217\'20\'19s words encourage people to look beyond the picture postcard and really value the wildlife that makes the South West such a great place to visit.\par \par \uc2 John Wedgwood Clarke, Professor of Poetry at the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2 , said:\par \par \uc2 The South West\u8217\'20\'19s diverse and beautiful landscapes have been the source of great joy for so many people and have inspired writers and artists over time. But take a closer look and you realise how fragile many of our ecosystems have become and the lengths to which our agencies and charities have to go in order to conserve their biodiversity.\par \par \uc2 I hope these films, and the visual and verbal poetry they contain, inspire people to explore this beautiful part of the world and think about how they can support, in whatever way they can, the work the goes in to helping people and nature thrive together in these special places.\par \par \uc2 John Clarke at Kynance. Credit Susan Willis\par \par \uc2 Professor Rosie Hails, Director of Nature and Science at the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  said:\par \par \uc2 We know that for people to protect nature and our fragile ecosystems, they have to care for it first. By using poetry and creating these films we aim to bring the beauty of these six south-west locations into their homes and onto their mobile devices, and to inspire them to visit and to help look after these special places.\par \par \uc2 Kynance on the Lizard Peninsula is one of our richest sites for rare and threatened species. The unique geology of granite cliffs with serpentine rocky exposures supports some of our most notable species such as land quilwort, pygmy rush and upright clover amongst the swathes of Cornish heath that make the site a National Nature Reserve.\par \par \uc2 As part of the Trust\u8217\'20\'19s new strategy we will be targeting the rejuvenation of these important plant varieties through innovative management techniques to ensure the special species thrive into the future.\par \par \uc2 The first of the films, which features Kynance on The Lizard, is released today on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://youtu.be/F4Lpu61T0vM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://youtu.be/F4Lpu61T0vM}}}\par \par \uc2 Others will be released weekly through to 21 July.\par \par \uc2 Notes to editors\par \par \uc2 Protected Site Strategies are ambitious and innovative in their approach to addressing the environmental issues impacting Protected Sites. They encourage collaborations with a wide range of stakeholders that operate at a landscape scale. This starts with the understanding that protected sites are representative examples of important places for nature and serve as indicators of healthy, naturally functioning landscapes. If the wildlife and physical \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  within sites are compromised by issues such as neglect or pollution, that indicates that the broader landscape is facing challenges that affect both nature and people.\par \par \uc2 RENEW is a five year programme led by the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2  and the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  and around 30 other partners from various sectors. It is funded by the UKRI Natural \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Council (\uc2 NERC\uc2 ) and aims to tackle the challenges of biodiversity renewal through a people-in-nature approach. This initiative involves a wide range of research to understand how people engage with nature and the opportunities and challenges this presents for nature recovery.\par \par \uc2 As a result, finding ways to balance human activities with efforts for nature recovery is central to the work of both RENEW and PSS.\par \par \uc2 The short films are being released weekly from Monday, 16 June in the following order\par \par \uc2 The sites are:\par \par \uc2 Kynance on the Lizard, Cornwall, 16 June\par \par \uc2 Goonhilly Downs National Nature Reserve, Cornwall, 23 June\par \par \uc2 Challacombe Farm, Dartmoor, 30 June\par \par \uc2 Westhay Moor National Nature Reserve, Somerset, 7 July\par \par \uc2 Exe Estuary, Devon, 14 July\par \par \uc2 Otter Estuary, Devon, 21 July\par \par \uc2 Film one, Kynance: Celebrates the landscape beauty and the unique wildlife in Kynance and the return of the chough to the Lizard peninsular in Cornwall - the focus of a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  project by \uc2 Natural England\uc2 , the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  and local farmers.\par \par \uc2 Film two, Goonhilly: Reveals the hidden richness of nature in a seemingly bleak heath and the abandoned workings of a former quarry while celebrating the collaborative \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts of \uc2 Natural England\uc2  and local farmers.\par \par \uc2 Film three, Challacombe Farm: A film about Challacombe Farm on Dartmoor features a local farmer who has nurtured wildlife habitats across his farm. The farm is part of a future landscape recovery plan to improve conditions for nature across the Moor while helping farms prosper.\par \par \uc2 Film four, Westhay Moor: Focusses on a large peat bog restoration project being carried out by Somerset Wildlife Trust. It explores the theme of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change which is bringing about impacts on nature and people highlights how peat restoration is essential in order to mitigate them.\par \par \uc2 Film five, Exe Estuary: Features the Exe Estuary in Devon, a vital refuge for migratory birds of great \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  concern, whose breeding and feeding grounds are increasingly threatened by intensive agriculture, development, and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 Film six, Otter Estuary: Presents the Lower Otter Restoration Project at Budleigh Salterton and the new wetlands - created by a partnership between \uc2 Clinton Devon Estates\uc2 , the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  Trust, the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency\uc2  and the Interreg (EU) programme - that absorb the impacts of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and attract a wealth of wildlife.\par \par \uc2 Photo credits: Susan Willis.\par \par \uc2 All footage copyright Simon Willis Films.

Credit Susan Willis\par \par \uc2 The stunning beauty of the South West has inspired many writers and artists, but now \uc2 Natural England\uc2  has joined forces with a poet and film maker to create a series of six inspiring videos about nature on protected sites in this corner of the country.\par \par \uc2 Taking in protected sites across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, the films, called \u8220\'20\'1CWild Westcountry Odyssey\u8221\'20\'1D are a result of a collaboration between \uc2 Natural England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Protected Site Strategies (PSS) Research and Development Programme and the [RENEW Biodiversity project] ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://renewbiodiversity.org.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://renewbiodiversity.org.uk/}}}\uc2 ) at the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2 . RENEW (Renewing biodiversity through a people in nature approach) is a collaboration between the\u8239\'20\'2FUniversity and the\u8239\'20\'2F\u8239\'20\'2F\uc2 National Trust\uc2 , funded by the \uc2 Natural \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Council\uc2 . It also partners with major \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  bodies like the \uc2 RSPB\uc2  and Wildlife Trusts.\par \par \uc2 The aim of future Protected Site Strategies will be to ensure the root causes of environmental issues - often driven by factors beyond the sites themselves - are addressed in ways that guarantee wildlife thrives on those sites, while helping nature recovery beyond their boundaries. All six of the Protected Sites chosen for the films are Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Habitat Sites.\par \par \uc2 Each film includes two short poems, specially written by John Wedgwood Clarke. The films celebrate the beauty and diversity of nature on the sites and the key achievements and projects that have restored habitats and species and are successfully tackling environmental change and impacts resulting from human activity\par \par \uc2 David Burton, \uc2 Natural England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Principal Officer for the Protected Site Strategies Implementation and Development programme, said:\par \par \uc2 We supported the production of the films to research how creative media can help re-set the relationships between people and nature within the framework of Protected Site Strategies. The approach is to educate and highlight the need for nature recovery to everyone.\par \par \uc2 Too often the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  sector has failed to communicate the plight of biodiversity in accessible, positive and thought-provoking ways. For Protected Site Strategies to realise the ambition we have set for them, resetting the relationships between nature and people in ways that build a resilient future for all, we need to harness the power of creative channels for our call to action.\par \par \uc2 John, Simon, and the rest of the \u8216\'20\'18Wild Westcountry Odyssey\u8217\'20\'19 team have created inspirational stories through film and poetry to help set our first few Protected Site Strategies on their way.\par \par \uc2 Simon Willis, filmmaker, said:\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s been a privilege to work with all the nature reserves and John. The human effort that goes into keeping them thriving for wildlife is remarkable.\par \par \uc2 I hope our images and John\u8217\'20\'19s words encourage people to look beyond the picture postcard and really value the wildlife that makes the South West such a great place to visit.\par \par \uc2 John Wedgwood Clarke, Professor of Poetry at the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2 , said:\par \par \uc2 The South West\u8217\'20\'19s diverse and beautiful landscapes have been the source of great joy for so many people and have inspired writers and artists over time. But take a closer look and you realise how fragile many of our ecosystems have become and the lengths to which our agencies and charities have to go in order to conserve their biodiversity.\par \par \uc2 I hope these films, and the visual and verbal poetry they contain, inspire people to explore this beautiful part of the world and think about how they can support, in whatever way they can, the work the goes in to helping people and nature thrive together in these special places.\par \par \uc2 Credit Susan Willis\par \par \uc2 Professor Rosie Hails, Director of Nature and Science at the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  said:\par \par \uc2 We know that for people to protect nature and our fragile ecosystems, they have to care for it first. By using poetry and creating these films we aim to bring the beauty of these six south-west locations into their homes and onto their mobile devices, and to inspire them to visit and to help look after these special places.\par \par \uc2 Kynance on the Lizard Peninsula is one of our richest sites for rare and threatened species. The unique geology of granite cliffs with serpentine rocky exposures supports some of our most notable species such as land quilwort, pygmy rush and upright clover amongst the swathes of Cornish heath that make the site a National Nature Reserve.\par \par \uc2 As part of the Trust\u8217\'20\'19s new strategy we will be targeting the rejuvenation of these important plant varieties through innovative management techniques to ensure the special species thrive into the future.\par \par \uc2 The first of the films, which features Kynance on The Lizard, is released today on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://youtu.be/F4Lpu61T0vM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://youtu.be/F4Lpu61T0vM}}}\par \par \uc2 Others will be released weekly through to 21 July. Notes to editors\par \par \uc2 Protected Site Strategies are ambitious and innovative in their approach to addressing the environmental issues impacting Protected Sites. They encourage collaborations with a wide range of stakeholders that operate at a landscape scale. This starts with the understanding that protected sites are representative examples of important places for nature and serve as indicators of healthy, naturally functioning landscapes. If the wildlife and physical \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  within sites are compromised by issues such as neglect or pollution, that indicates that the broader landscape is facing challenges that affect both nature and people.\par \par \uc2 RENEW is a five year programme led by the \uc2 University of Exeter\uc2  and the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  and around 30 other partners from various sectors. It is funded by the UKRI Natural \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Council (\uc2 NERC\uc2 ) and aims to tackle the challenges of biodiversity renewal through a people-in-nature approach. This initiative involves a wide range of research to understand how people engage with nature and the opportunities and challenges this presents for nature recovery.\par \par \uc2 As a result, finding ways to balance human activities with efforts for nature recovery is central to the work of both RENEW and PSS.\par \par \uc2 The short films are being released weekly from Monday, 16 June in the following order\par \par \uc2 The sites are:\par \par \uc2 Kynance on the Lizard, Cornwall, 16 June\par \par \uc2 Goonhilly Downs National Nature Reserve, Cornwall, 23 June\par \par \uc2 Challacombe Farm, Dartmoor, 30 June\par \par \uc2 Westhay Moor National Nature Reserve, Somerset, 7 July\par \par \uc2 Exe Estuary, Devon, 14 July\par \par \uc2 Otter Estuary, Devon, 21 July\par \par \uc2 Film one, Kynance: Celebrates the landscape beauty and the unique wildlife in Kynance and the return of the chough to the Lizard peninsular in Cornwall - the focus of a \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  project by \uc2 Natural England\uc2 , the \uc2 National Trust\uc2  and local farmers.\par \par \uc2 Film two, Goonhilly: Reveals the hidden richness of nature in a seemingly bleak heath and the abandoned workings of a former quarry while celebrating the collaborative \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts of \uc2 Natural England\uc2  and local farmers.\par \par \uc2 Film three, Challacombe Farm: A film about Challacombe Farm on Dartmoor features a local farmer who has nurtured wildlife habitats across his farm. The farm is part of a future landscape recovery plan to improve conditions for nature across the Moor while helping farms prosper.\par \par \uc2 Film four, Westhay Moor: Focusses on a large peat bog restoration project being carried out by Somerset Wildlife Trust. It explores the theme of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change which is bringing about impacts on nature and people highlights how peat restoration is essential in order to mitigate them.\par \par \uc2 Film five, Exe Estuary: Features the Exe Estuary in Devon, a vital refuge for migratory birds of great \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  concern, whose breeding and feeding grounds are increasingly threatened by intensive agriculture, development, and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 Film six, Otter Estuary: Presents the Lower Otter Restoration Project at Budleigh Salterton and the new wetlands - created by a partnership between \uc2 Clinton Devon Estates\uc2 , the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  Trust, the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Agency\uc2  and the Interreg (EU) programme - that absorb the impacts of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and attract a wealth of wildlife.\par \par \uc2 Photo credits: Susan Willis.\par \par \uc2 All footage copyright Simon Willis Films.

The movie is set in the fictional kingdom of Arendelle, which is modelled on a fjord landscape, complete with a large glacier at the head of Arenfjord. Ice unsurprisingly plays a very prominent role in the story. Yet this glacier receives very little attention.\par \par \uc2 Glaciers are receding across the world at an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 unprecedented rate}}}\uc2 . And on more than one occasion I have wondered how Arendelle\u8217\'20\'19s glacier might have fared since the time of Frozen.\par \par \uc2 To add some scientific rigour to this thought experiment, it is useful to approximate a real geographical location. Arendelle is inspired by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://dx.doi.org/10.19030/iber.v17i2.10144"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fjords of western Norway}}}\uc2 , a region where most of the glaciers flow from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1017/aog.2023.70"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jostedalsbreen ice cap}}}\uc2 , the largest ice mass in mainland Europe.\par \par \uc2 We can also approximate the date. Based on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Arendelle#:~:text=Given%20that%20Frozen%20takes%20place,Anna%27s%20nineteenth%20birthday%20in%201844."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 various clues}}}\uc2 , including the clothing and technology on show, it appears the events in Frozen take place one July in the mid-19th century. This means the glacier is depicted towards the end of the little ice age, a cool period lasting several centuries during which most northern hemisphere glaciers expanded to their largest size in recent history.\par \par \uc2 In the movie, the glacier plunges from a high elevation plateau into the fjord below and looks steep and crevassed at the front. This implies a healthy, advancing glacier, in a similar condition to the many outlet glaciers of Jostedalsbreen that reached their {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107501"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 little ice age maximum positions}}}\uc2  around this time.\par \par \uc2 The short-term health of Arendelle\u8217\'20\'19s glacier may have been further boosted by the unseasonal summer snowfall and cold temperatures that Elsa\u8217\'20\'19s powers unleashed on the kingdom.\par \par \uc2 Real glaciers are shrinking fast\par \par \uc2 The fate of the fictional glacier since the little ice age would have been less positive, as demonstrated by the very real glaciers of Jostedalsbreen. This period has been characterised by accelerated \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  warming, causing widespread glacier retreat and thinning.\par \par \uc2 Since Elsa\u8217\'20\'19s time, the real glaciers it\u8217\'20\'19s based on have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107501"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 shrunk by about a fifth}}}\uc2 .

This makes it likely that, without any further help from Elsa, Arendelle\u8217\'20\'19s glacier would have retreated onto land within decades of the time of the film.How Jostedalsbreen\u8217\'20\'19s glaciers have retreated from the little ice age (red outline) to today (blue).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/spatiotemporal-variability-in-geometry-and-geodetic-mass-balance-of-jostedalsbreen-ice-cap-norway/AF75418588F0B45113FCCC933907DD7F#figures"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Andreassen et al. 2023}}}\par \par \uc2 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, an increase in winter snowfall in western Norway meant most major glaciers in the region {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683611414938"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 began to advance}}}\uc2  up to a few hundred metres. The Arendelle glacier might therefore have grown again for a time, although probably not enough for the glacier to re-enter the fjord. While there are other explanations, the more imaginative mind might consider the possibility that a descendent of Elsa was responsible for this period of increased snowfall.\par \par \uc2 Since the early 2000s, those same glaciers have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2020.10"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 shrunk significantly}}}\uc2 , retreating by up to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1017/aog.2023.70"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 70 metres per year}}}\uc2 . That\u8217\'20\'19s largely because higher air temperatures mean {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1017/aog.2024.41"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 more ice is melting}}}\uc2  in summer. Several of Jostedalsbreen\u8217\'20\'19s glaciers have retreated almost back onto the plateau, while others are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107501"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 disconnecting from the larger ice bodies}}}\uc2  that have been nourishing them for centuries.\par \par \uc2 What would Arendelle\u8217\'20\'19s glacier look like today?\par \par \uc2 Retreat of this scale means the fictional glacier today might look something like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.google.com/maps/@61.665933,6.8932976,3500m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMzMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Briksdalsbreen}}}\uc2 , now just a small tongue spilling over from the plateau ice behind.

By 2050, approximately 200 years after the time of Frozen, the glacier would probably have retreated onto the plateau. The ice cap would also have thinned considerably and might even be in the early stages of terminal break up.\par \par \uc2 However, while this is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/5799/2024/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 one potential scenario for Jostedalsbreen in the 21st century}}}\uc2 , it is by no means certain. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \b  \highlight22Climate\b0 \highlight22  scientists agree}}}\uc2  that concerted action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming.\par \par \uc2 Magic helped Arendelle once.

Indian Express Group \par \par \uc2 Nawazuddin Siddiqui may have made his film debut with John Matthew Matthan\u8217\'20\'19s 1999 cop thriller Sarfarosh, but he didn\u8217\'20\'19t get his breakout role till Anurag Kashyap\u8217\'20\'19s gangster epic Gangs of Wasseypur \u8211\'20\'13 Part 2 in 2012. Those 14 years of relentless strife are so ingrained in him that playing a struggling actor was a cakewalk for him in Dibakar Banerjee\u8217\'20\'19s segment \u8216\'20\'18Star\u8217\'20\'19 in the 2013 anthology \uc2 Bombay Talkies\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now, after 12 years of playing the lead in several films across languages and genres, Siddiqui will be seen essaying a struggling actor yet again in Aditya Kripalani\u8217\'20\'19s upcoming movie Main Actor Nahi Hoon (I\u8217\'20\'19m Not An Actor). He plays a banker and an aspiring actor who becomes an acting coach to a woman in Mumbai over FaceTime.\par \par \uc2 For an actor worth his salt, playing a struggling one comes easy or tough? ""It\u8217\'20\'19s very easy because that phase was very long. I was a struggling actor for 12-15 years. I\u8217\'20\'19m still struggling, though in different ways. But yes, when you have first-hand experience, it becomes quite easy to play a character," says Siddiqui in an exclusive interview with SCREEN.\par \par \uc2 "From the very first day, his pitch as a bad actor was just perfect. It wasn\u8217\'20\'19t too dramatic or fake. The acting seemed naturally bad. That\u8217\'20\'19s the best compliment I can give (laughs)," says Kripalani. For both the actors and the filmmaker, the challenges were more logistical than creative. For instance, it\u8217\'20\'19s the first film that\u8217\'20\'19s been fully shot in real time over FaceTime across 28 days.\par \par \uc2 While Siddiqui was shivering in Germany, his co-star Chitrangada Satarpura was sweating in Mumbai. "Like me, Nawaz comes from a place which isn\u8217\'20\'19t too cold. He was in Germany in 2 degrees, so was in quite a bad shape," points out Kripalani. "The \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  impacts your performance a lot. It was so cold I couldn\u8217\'20\'19t even pronounce the \u8216\'20\'18r\u8217\'20\'19 when I had to say English words like process. Also, I had to narrate chunky Shakespeare dialogues in English. Even though I have done Shakespeare plays in Hindi in the past, the English words would just not come out right because of the cold," says Siddiqui.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  difference posed bigger hurdles in the filming process. While Siddiqui would wonder why it\u8217\'20\'19s taking so long for the Mumbai crew to go for a retake, Kripalani had to remind him that the camera there has stopped working because of overheating. "They couldn\u8217\'20\'19t empathize with each other because while Chitrangada was getting scorched, she couldn\u8217\'20\'19t imagine Nawaz shivering," says Kripalani.\par \par \uc2 Another refreshing challenge for Siddiqui was to not be confined by space. He\u8217\'20\'19d film the scene with Chitrangada over FaceTime while walking the streets of Germany or boarding a tram. "With Nawaz on a tram and Chitra in the local train, we couldn\u8217\'20\'19t shoot for 18 minutes without breaks. Although FaceTime is far smoother than other video-calling applications, we all know how the network is so patchy in Mumbai," reasons Kripalani.\par \par \uc2 "Plus, to look at each other on video call and emote, I\u8217\'20\'19m sure it wasn\u8217\'20\'19t easy," says Kripalani. Siddiqui agrees that was challenging, but it was part of the world he created for this film. "There\u8217\'20\'19s a belief system an actor works with in every project. In this film, we just believed that we have to talk only on video calls. That became our world, our life," says Siddiqui.\par \par \uc2 "We met for the first time on FaceTime itself. We weren\u8217\'20\'19t allowed to meet after that, so that\u8217\'20\'19s how her character started appearing to me as well. I actually believed she\u8217\'20\'19s as irritating as her character. Because other than the takes, we just said \u8216\'20\'18Hi, hello\u8217\'20\'19 to each other on FaceTime," reveals Siddiqui, adding, "Chitrangada isa young and formidable actor. So you get aware and are on your toes all the time."\par \par \uc2 Kripalani made sure that he conveyed all his directions to the actors through each other. "Direct direction is quite dumb so I didn\u8217\'20\'19t go there. If I had to say something to Nawaz, I\u8217\'20\'19d do that through Chitra and vice-versa. When I used to direct them through each other, their stimulus was quite natural," explains Kripalani.\par \par \uc2 Siddiqui also appreciated that the film worked with a very small crew of 10, as opposed to the films he shot for before and after this one, which boasted of a crew strength of 300 to 400. "I feel if it\u8217\'20\'19s a smaller crew, you work better and faster. Otherwise people keep shouting and don\u8217\'20\'19t ensure that the actor is given the silence they need. You need to create a conducive atmosphere for a good performance. I\u8217\'20\'19m not Manto who can write in the midst of a crowd," says Siddiqui, chuckling, since he played the prolific Pakistani writer in Nandita Das\u8217\'20\'19 2018 biopic.\par \par \uc2 Main Actor Nahi Hoon premiered at the Cinequest Film Festival, which takes place in San Jose, California, right next to the \uc2 Apple\uc2  headquarters. "It was quite serendipitous that someone from \uc2 Apple\uc2  was sitting next to us and they realized this has been shot completely on iPhones and other \uc2 Apple\uc2  devices. Which is why they decided to help us promote the film," recalls Kripalani.\par \par \uc2 But he feels independent cinema otherwise hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been able to reach the pre-pandemic level yet. "We haven\u8217\'20\'19t been able to escape the claws of Covid yet. OTT became so dominant in our lives then that we\u8217\'20\'19re still struggling to make an independent film that can release in theatres. So it\u8217\'20\'19s unfortunately become a monopoly what kind of films will release in theatres," says Kripalani.\par \par \uc2 Also Read \u8212\'20\'14 After Anurag Kashyap\u8217\'20\'19s dig at \uc2 Netflix\uc2  CEO, Nawazuddin Siddiqui shows disappointment in streaming platforms: \u8216\'20\'18Shuruat passion se hoti hai, fir dhandha ban jata hai\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 He credits actors like Siddiqui for enabling independent cinema since he didn\u8217\'20\'19t charge a single rupee for the film and came onboard as a producer. "If you have power, then share it and elevate others. If everyone starts doing that, no force can keep us down. But every person just starts hoarding the power instead of using or sharing it here. If more powerful people come to a project only with passion, instead of a commerce point of view, so many new projects can start," says Kripalani, adding, "But that\u8217\'20\'19s the challenge with this journey: the more you have to lose, the more scared you become."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/06/MixCollage-15-Jun-2025-03-39-PM-1718.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays a struggling actor in Main Actor Nahi Hoon.}}}\par \par \uc2 Document INEXON0020250617el6g0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Release date - 13062025\par \par \uc2 THOUSAND OAKS\uc2  - \uc2 Amgen\uc2  (NASDAQ: AMGN) announced the launch of The Making of a Heart Attack, a documentary that sheds light on the cardiovascular disease crisis in the United States, where every 40 seconds someone has a heart attack or stroke.\par \par \uc2 The Making of a Heart Attack features renowned former football running back, Barry Sanders, who reveals he experienced a heart attack on Father's Day in 2024 and what he's learned since then about high LDL or 'bad' cholesterol-a leading, but often hidden risk factor for cardiovascular events.\par \par \uc2 'I've spent my life as a professional athlete taking care of my body, but I had no idea I was living with a silent risk that could lead to a heart attack,' said Sanders. 'My message to other people is simple: don't wait. Get your LDL-C tested and talk to your doctor. Knowing your number is an important step to understanding your risk.'\par \par \uc2 More than 40% of adults with high LDL-C in the U.S. do not know their levels are high.8 The documentary educates viewers about LDL-C and how it can lead to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, putting individuals at risk of a cardiovascular event.\par \par \uc2 'We know that high LDL-C is one of the leading, yet most modifiable, risk factors for heart attack and stroke.1 However, the cardiovascular disease public health crisis continues,' said Paul Burton, M.D., senior vice president and chief medical officer at \uc2 Amgen\uc2 . 'The Making of a Heart Attack should be a wake-up call for everyone. \uc2 Amgen\uc2  is committed to leading change by increasing LDL-C testing and encouraging patients and the entire healthcare system to act with urgency to overcome inertia and address this issue.'\par \par \uc2 Featured alongside Sanders sharing their own stories of living with cardiovascular disease are Hyvelle Ferguson-Davis, founder of Heart Sistas; Tara Robinson, CEO of the Black Heart Association; Gigi Campos, a \uc2 WomenHeart\uc2  Champion and her father, Ponciano Gari. Sara Collins, M.D., FACC, an interventional cardiologist and member of the Association of Black Cardiologists, provides her expert medical perspective throughout.\par \par \uc2 The documentary is part of \uc2 Amgen\uc2 's broader ambition to cut the number of heart attacks and strokes in the U.S. in half by 2030. Working with advocacy leaders, medical societies, healthcare systems and research institutions, \uc2 Amgen\uc2  is advancing efforts to drive earlier LDL-C testing, expand access to care and improve health outcomes.\par \par \uc2 Watch The Making of a Heart Attack on June 14, 2025, at 1 p.m. ET on A&E (check local listings). The documentary will be available to watch online at AttackHeartDisease.com/Documentary beginning June 16, 2025 and will be featured at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2025.\par \par \uc2 About \uc2 Amgen\par \par \uc2 Amgen\uc2  discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to help millions of patients in their fight against some of the world's toughest diseases.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including \uc2 BeOne Medicines Ltd.\uc2  or \uc2 Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\uc2 ), the performance of Otezla (apremilast), our acquisitions of \uc2 ChemoCentryx, Inc.\uc2  or \uc2 Horizon Therapeutics plc\uc2  (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  reports filed by \uc2 Amgen\uc2 , including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, \uc2 Amgen\uc2  is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\par \par \uc2 No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions, including those resulting from geopolitical relations and government actions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  objectives. The effects of global \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\par \par \uc2 Contact:\par \par \uc2 Elissa Snook Tel: 609-251-1407\par \par \uc2 Justin Claeys Tel: 805-313-9775\par \par \uc2 [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk]\par \par \uc2 Document ENPNEW0020250616el6g000g1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It is only with the technological advances of the 20th and 21st centuries that we have been able to see what dwells beneath the waves, but only now have we begun to turn our attention away from the enchanting magic of the ocean towards the beasts senselessly destroying it.\par \par \uc2 The documentary features devastatingly detailed and unforgiving footage of bottom trawling, a fishing technique that involves dragging large nets across the sea floor, capturing and destroying all in its path. So massive are the scars left behind that they are visible from space, Attenborough says.\par \par \uc2 Released in the lead-up to the \uc2 UN\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://unfoundation.org/2025-un-ocean-conference/?gad_source=1andgad_campaignid=19556432845andgbraid=0AAAAAD9kiAflUM7nkzH2TuVh8yWdezC4Randgclid=CjwKCAjwgb_CBhBMEiwA0p3oOGiWm2KTKyCHs_WFe4rMrPMtAF_LLiDYc2a_IcoTVNFMO1yKRcj_1BoC-M4QAvD_BwE"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ocean Conference}}}\uc2 , which began on 9 June, Ocean with David Attenborough is a clear call to action. It aims to galvanise global support for banning bottom trawling and expanding marine protected areas. There is also growing pressure on nations to ratify the High Seas Treaty, a crucial agreement that will only come into force once 60 countries have ratified it. As of 9 June, just 32 had done so.\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 UN\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s hands\par \par \uc2 The scenes of the barren graveyard left behind by trawlers are quickly banished by Attenborough\u8217\'20\'19s declaration of hope. Marine life has a remarkable ability to recover \u8211\'20\'13 if only left alone, he says.\par \par \uc2 Read more: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2025-06-10-sa-joins-134-nations-in-new-push-for-high-seas-protection-treaty/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 South Africa joins 134 nations in new push for High Seas protection treaty}}}\par \par \uc2 Within just a few years life can bounce back. No matter how overfished and exploited the ocean is, if an area is protected for long enough, life stubbornly returns. In addition, healing is not limited to protected areas \u8211\'20\'13 life leaks out, carried by the currents.\par \par \uc2 Only 3% of the world\u8217\'20\'19s oceans are fully protected from exploitation. Attenborough hints at the solution: protecting at least 30%. But, delivered as his \u8220\'20\'1Cgreatest message of hope\u8221\'20\'1D, the film risks lulling audiences into inaction. In a time of unprecedented urgency, could hope inadvertently breed complacency?\par \par \uc2 The UK recently announced it would extend bans on bottom trawling from 18,000km\u178\'00\'B2 to 30,000km\u178\'00\'B2 of its offshore areas, affecting 41 of its 128 marine protected areas.\par \par \uc2 France, co-host of the Ocean Conference with Costa Rica, boasts that it has surpassed the 30% protection target set for 2030. But environmental groups warn of a troubling discrepancy between promises and practice. In reality, despite the claims, only about 3% of French waters are protected from destructive activities.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 advocacy group Oceana\uc2 , more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels operated for more than 17,000 hours in 2024 in France\u8217\'20\'19s six marine nature parks in European waters.\par \par \uc2 Attenborough also draws attention to a more insidious problem: enforcement. In international waters, where no single nation has jurisdiction, ensuring compliance is exceedingly difficult. Marine protection, he suggests, has often amounted to little more than optics.\par \par \uc2 Out of sight, out of mind\par \par \uc2 Ocean conservationist Luke McMillan said in a \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  post: \u8220\'20\'1CPerhaps [the documentary\u8217\'20\'19s] gentleness will be its strength. If not, then I fear we\u8217\'20\'19re lost. If Sir David can\u8217\'20\'19t move the needle, what hope is left for the rest of us trying to?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Renee Bonorchis, founder of The Ocean Advocate, points out that Attenborough focuses on bottom trawling, but the ocean faces far more adversity than this issue. One example is the acidification of water caused by increased carbon dioxide in the air, which causes the calcium carbonate that makes up sea creatures\u8217\'20\'19 shells to \u8220\'20\'1Cmelt\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The documentary may cause some consternation for a few days, but once that feeling fades amid the bustle of daily life, will the state of the ocean once again be a case of out of sight, out of mind?\par \par \uc2 Attenborough has declared this documentary to be his last as he approaches his centenary. But, having left the fate of the ocean in the hands of the \uc2 UN\uc2 , the documentary dangles the tempting comfort of complacency. If it\u8217\'20\'19s all up to them, what can we do anyway?\par \par \uc2 The Ocean Conference has the mandate to formalise an ocean agreement. \u8220\'20\'1CIf these agreements are reached and stuck to, it will make a difference, but we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen so many global agreements and treaties and very few of them are fully committed to by the member states, which is why it comes down to us, as individuals,\u8221\'20\'1D Bonorchis says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you want to see the change, be the change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Practical steps to make a difference in South Africa\par \par \uc2 Download the Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative (Sassi) mobile app: Get readily available information about sustainable seafood on your phone by downloading this useful app from \uc2 Google\uc2  Play or the App Store.\par \par \uc2 Avoid single-use plastics: Use canvas bags for shopping and support stores that use sustainable, biodegradable packaging.\par \par \uc2 Get actionable insights into adapting your context for \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2 : Download the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sst.org.za"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sustainable Seas Trust\u8217\'20\'19s Plastic-Free Seas: An Action-Focused Guide for Plastic Management in Africa}}}\uc2  to learn how the Global South can become the world\u8217\'20\'19s leader in sustainable waste management.\par \par \uc2 Marine-friendly sunscreen: Many sunscreens contain harmful chemicals that damage coral reefs and other marine life.

Film festival highlights the Cerrado's role in balancing the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Present at the meeting, Takum\u227\'00\'E3 Kuikuro (photo), an award-winning Brazilian filmmaker from the Xingu Indigenous Park in Mato Grosso, pointed out two dimensions of his work that he sees most often among his indigenous peers, including himself.\par \par \uc2 "There are two ways of making movies in the villages. One is to document, to record [oral] knowledge that will remain forever circulating for the people in the villages. The other way is to create your own narrative about reality, translate it into Portuguese so that non-indigenous people can understand our reality, and show it through cinema," he said in a conversation with Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil.\par \par \uc2 Takum\u227\'00\'E3's films have won awards at festivals such as Gramado and Bras\u237\'00\'EDlia, and at international film events such as Presence Autochtone de Terres en Vues, in Montr\u233\'00\'E9al, Canada. In 2017, he received an honorary fellowship from Queen Mary University London. And in 2019, he became the first indigenous juror at the Brazilian Film Festival in Brasilia, one of the most important in the country.\par \par \uc2 At Fica 2025, the filmmaker collaborated in the process of selecting works for competitive screenings. He has come to see a maturing of indigenous audiovisual production and defends the need to overcome the old ethnographic narratives that have permeated film production about traditional peoples for decades, both inside and outside the country.\par \par \uc2 "We have to overcome the ethnographic narrative as the only language [about indigenous people in cinema], that has been my concern. And explore the cinematographic language in depth to tell our own stories, create our own characters, making, for example, more fiction films," he argues.\par \par \uc2 Goi\u225\'00\'E1s Velho (GO), 13/06/2025 - Vicent Carelli talks to Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil during the 26th edition of the International Environmental Film and Video Festival (Fica 2025). Photo: Jo\u233\'00\'E9dson Alves/Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil A member of the official jury for Fica 2025, award-winning filmmaker and indigenist Vincent Carelli, creator of the Video in the Villages project (1987), which has been training indigenous filmmakers since the mid-1980s, sees fundamental differences in filmmaking between indigenous and non-indigenous people.\par \par \uc2 "This access with intimacy, with the language, with the knowledge and coexistence of the culture is something else. This, in terms of content, sensitivity, both for those filming and those being filmed, is a big difference," he says.\par \par \uc2 "I've always tried to get away from this idea of ethnographic cinema in order to reflect on indigenous issues."\par \par \uc2 Symmetrical relationships Over the last few years, collaboration between indigenous and non-indigenous people has been a constant in cinema about traditional peoples, but this process still takes place amid tensions.\par \par \uc2 "When you go to the villages, they all say they've had negative experiences with the press, with researchers, with television, and with filmmakers, you know. All the agents. Because then there's this lack of symmetry in the relationship," Vincent Carelli points out. "This is something that still happens, but these young indigenous filmmakers are taking a more forceful stance against it these days, putting themselves forward as directors, signing their works," he adds.\par \par \uc2 "I see a lot of non-indigenous people putting themselves above indigenous people, excluding them from the most important festivals. I, for example, took part in the Gramado Festival in 2011. I won a Kikito [award] there, but after that I never heard of any indigenous people taking part. So this recognition is still a bit isolated," says Takum\u227\'00\'E3 Kuikuro.\par \par \uc2 "We still face a certain amount of prejudice when it comes to occupying this space," says Kl\u233\'00\'E9ber Xukuru, an indigenous filmmaker and communicator, director of Ororub\u225\'00\'E1 Filmes. "But it's good to remember that the indigenous peoples of Brazil are resistant and insistent. And audiovisual is a tool that today we have also seen as a gateway to struggle," he says.\par \par \uc2 The indigenous gaze In the movie My Foreign Land, this issue appears both on and off screen. The feature, which premiered to great acclaim at the \u201\'00\'C9 Tudo Verdade festival in April, was the main guest film at Fica this year, and had three screenings in cinemas in the former capital of Goi\u225\'00\'E1s. It is a collaboration between the Lakapoy collective, made up of indigenous people, Louise Botkay, who was trained by the Video in the Villages project, and Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Moreira Salles.\par \par \uc2 The film follows the chief Almir Suru\u237\'00\'ED, an indigenous leader who is running for federal deputy for Rond\u244\'00\'F4nia, and his daughter, Txai Suru\u237\'00\'ED, a young environmental activist, during the 40 days leading up to the 2022 elections. Txai's trajectory in the film was accompanied by Salles. The result is two simultaneous, complementary and distinct looks at the journeys of father and daughter.\par \par \uc2 One scene in the film discusses exactly this point, when in a dialog between Txai and Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Moreira Salles, the director questions himself and her about the gaze of a white man (in this case, himself) towards the indigenous activist, focused only on militancy for land rights. At this point, she comments that an indigenous director could have chosen to go beyond filming the activist in action, but to follow other dimensions of her life, such as her relationship with the forest and with love.\par \par \uc2 Screening window One of the new features of this edition of Fica is the creation of the Indigenous and Traditional Peoples Forum, with the aim of amplifying the knowledge and expertise of the peoples of the territories and strengthening audiovisual production by people who are part of these communities. In addition to this forum, the festival also has the Cinema and \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  forums, created in previous editions.\par \par \uc2 One of the competitive exhibitions is exclusively dedicated to showing and rewarding works by indigenous filmmakers and those from traditional peoples and communities. "It's a specific window for these directors, without prejudice to the fact that they will also be in the other shows, as they always have been and will continue to be," says the festival's programming director, Pedro Novaes.\par \par \uc2 * The Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil reporting team travelled at the invitation of the 26th Fica organization.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250615el6f007yv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw158\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2370\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc78}{\*\bkmkend toc78}\b \uc2 Interview: Shankar Borua Unpacks "Blue Ocean" - His Groundbreaking Hindi Film\b0\par\par\uc2 Prantik Deka \par \uc2 2,863 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 June 2025\par \uc2 Northeast Now\par \uc2 NEANOW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2025. Northeast Now \par \par \uc2 Guwahati, June 15 -- Dr. Shankar Borua is a distinguished scholar-practitioner, filmmaker, entrepreneur, and startup mentor with over two decades of multifaceted experience across academia, creative industries, and entrepreneurial ecosystems in both North America and South Asia. Born and raised in Assam, Dr. Borua holds a Ph.D. in Mass Communications from \uc2 Texas Tech University\uc2 , USA. His doctoral research, titled "American Political Documentaries: Structure, Agency, and Communication of Meaning," reflects his deep academic engagement with media, culture, and storytelling.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Borua's career seamlessly blends rigorous academic scholarship with hands-on industry practice. In a well-regarded body of work that defies easy categorization and has consistently captivated audiences everywhere, he has written, directed, produced, and starred in a number of independent films. His filmography includes critically recognized titles such as Angst at Large, If God Be With Us, All Those Longings, Center Mass, Hope is a Good Thing, Beleaguered, Grief on a Sunday Morning, The Curiosity Shop, and Colorful.\par \par \uc2 Shankar Borua's newest film, BLUE OCEAN, produced in Hindi, English, and Punjabi, is an intriguing blend of thriller, drama, and philosophy that guides viewers on a journey where the distinctions between truth and deception become indistinct. The upcoming film is poised to captivate audiences with its blend of mystery and psychological intrigue. In this exclusive interview with Prantik Deka, Dr. Borua talks about BLUE OCEAN, a gripping Himalayan narrative woven with themes of crime, greed, deceit, and betrayal, all enmeshed and intertwined in Dehradun, India, nestled at the foothills of the majestic Himalayas.\par \par \uc2 Edited excerpts:\par \par \uc2 Prantik Deka: In the past, you have made films that delve into powerful social narratives, addressing various issues faced by communities in Assam and the Northeast region, frequently shedding light on injustice, inequality, or the need for social transformation. What was the driving force behind the inception of this new project, BLUE OCEAN? I believe this is your maiden venture into the world of Hindi cinema.\par \par \uc2 Shankar Borua: The mountains have always beckoned and embraced me, and they never let me down. I first thought of BLUE OCEAN a couple of months after my arrival in Dehradun in the spring of 2024, following a rather uneasy and unhappy couple of years leading up to my Daddy's passing in January 2024. 'Blue Ocean,' the gym in Dehradun where I signed up to spend about an hour each morning working out, is where a rather expansive narrative in my head first triggered. I mentioned the idea to a friend who is a Professor at a University here in Dehradun; she liked it, and I felt encouraged to explore more! I conceived BLUE OCEAN as a fictitious yet realistic tale, incorporating the gym at the center of the narrative and allowing elements and characters to float around it yet gravitate towards it.\par \par \uc2 It was a challenge to shoot a movie without a bound script-the first time ever for me! Yet, it truly was liberating and quite exhilarating to indulge in this free-form storytelling and to literally encourage the talent to go with the flow, much to the surprise of our actors and also the crew! We shot the entire film over nine days in my neighborhood of Rajender Nagar in Dehradun; for a day, we shot in Chandigarh and also at Paonta Sahib Gurudwara in Himachal Pradesh, where Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru of the Sikhs, wrote the 10th Chapter of the Holy Book, the Guru Granth Sahib, on the banks of the River Yamuna.\par \par \uc2 Yes, this is my maiden venture into the world of Hindi cinema, traditionally dominated, of course, by the star system and formulaic films. Having said that, it is pertinent to point out that there are all kinds of Hindi cinema today, as in the past, and it is imprudent to put a wide range of content into neat genre boxes; that will definitely not be wise! BLUE OCEAN, I believe, touches upon many thematic considerations, and so you just cannot put this little movie from the mountains into a little box on a shelf somewhere, no way!\par \par \uc2 PD: The Himalayas function as a significant and influential element in shaping the narrative of BLUE OCEAN. To what extent does the presence of the Himalayas impact the conceptualization of the story?\par \par \uc2 SB: BLUE OCEAN is a Himalayan narrative set at the foothills of the hoary Himalayas in Dehradun, India, where I have been living for a little over a year now. The movie is deeply embedded with the twin subtexts of the Himalayan identity on the one hand and the Himalayan crisis on the other. As we all know, this is one of the most ecologically sensitive mountain regions in the world, under constant pressure for decades now from catastrophic human intervention in the name of tourism and development activities, accompanied, of course, by the disastrous effects of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change. Naturally, my own journey as a wilderness enthusiast finds its way into the narrative. I am taking this opportunity to mention that a section of the proceeds generated by streaming BLUE OCEAN will go towards the \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the beautiful, elusive Alpine Musk Deer, an endangered species in the Himalayan ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 We will also donate a portion of the proceeds towards the protection of our marine ecosystems in our wondrous oceans; they take care of close to a third of the carbon dioxide that is generated by us on this planet, this beautiful 'pale blue dot' of ours is our only home! So, yes, the mighty Himalayas are an integral part of the film, and their presence across the narrative is palpable. Folks, however, will not see a snow-clad Nanda Devi or Trishul in BLUE OCEAN, beautiful Himalayan peaks that, I am sure, have inspired mountaineers, photographers, and filmmakers across generations. What they will clearly sense, though, is the deep crisis in the Himalayan region and people waking up to it, albeit a little too late. May I mention that the Himalayas extend all the way from Pir Panjal (also known as the Lesser Himalayas) to Northeast India and Upper Burma; these magnanimous mountains have given birth to rivers and civilizations while nurturing communities and cultures for thousands of years.\par \par \uc2 So, you can well imagine how 'significant and influential,' to use your phrase, the Himalayas are to me personally as the filmmaker weaving BLUE OCEAN, and hence, of course, to the narrative as well. A brilliant yet achingly beautiful and poignant song written for the movie by acclaimed Bollywood lyricist-composer Shellee, a buddy of mine from back in the day, highlights the tragedy of the Himalayas - "Ek Chiraiyya Purvai Se Nir Pata Hai Puche" - A bird asks the easterly winds about its nest that it can't find - Little does it know that the tree holding its nest has been decapitated by humans! Such is the tragedy of the Himalayas!\par \par \uc2 PD: What specific elements did you consider when transitioning from gritty realism to the captivating genre of thriller in your storytelling? How did you navigate this creative process?\par \par \uc2 SB: BLUE OCEAN is unlike any of my other films in terms of its treatment; that is true. It is fairly realistic (of course, not the 'gritty realism' in the tradition of the 1950s British classic Night and the City), yet always kind of operates in this twilight zone between fantasy and reality, between truth and falsehood. Interestingly, the audience knows who's who and what's going on while the characters don't! I tried this treatment as a whodunit in reverse; we don't know if it's going to stick or not, but we tried throwing something out there to see if it does.\par \par \uc2 The gym itself, with all the mirrors, as a 'space' and as the 'proscenium theater' where the drama and subterfuge unfold in BLUE OCEAN, can be quite phantasmagoric. Here, the 'gaze' is not at the 'other.' The 'gaze' is on one's own self in the mirror, quite an exercise in narcissism in this digital age of Selfies and Reels! Once you step out of the gym into the real world and no longer stare at yourself on your phone, you come back to 'gritty realism.'\par \par \uc2 To answer your question, though, you have to navigate creatively each film and story on its own terms; you have to meet the story somewhere in the middle. If you try to come on too hard, there is a distinct possibility that the story is going to fly off the handle, of course, at the peril of losing your audience halfway through! It's tricky territory, but isn't that what you are supposed to be navigating as the director! I really like your use of the word 'navigate' - it is all about navigating at the end of the day, just like life!\par \par \uc2 PD: What type of research and design efforts were involved in BLUE OCEAN, a Himalayan tale set in Dehradun? Could you provide details about the artistes and technicians involved in the project?\par \par \uc2 SB: The research and design for BLUE OCEAN had to ensure that we stuck to everything the way it is - no alterations, no additions, no embellishments, no messing around with real locations where the entire film was shot in December 2024. What we portray on screen is exactly what you will see walking around my neighborhood of Rajender Nagar in Dehradun today.\par \par \uc2 We shot through the night with our actors at 'Blue Ocean,' the gym, to make sure we did not disrupt their business during the day. Outside of that, I cannot even begin to tell you about the cooperation and warmth that the crew of BLUE OCEAN received from the businesses and stores where we shot extensively - New Kamal Dairy, MBA Chaiwala, \uc2 Costa Coffee\uc2 , Sheesha Lounge & Restaurant, Horilal Vegetable & Fruit Juice Corner, Bollywood Bar & Lounge, Heaven's Rooftop & Skylounge, Banjara, Mind & Body, and many more. I remain forever grateful to all these folks for making BLUE OCEAN possible with their generosity and kindness.\par \par \uc2 As for the crew, it was a sheer miracle to have my talented MBA students as the two Executive Producers and the two Directors of Photography on BLUE OCEAN. They were interning on a feature-length movie for the first time, and it is one internship they are all going to remember, I am sure, for a long time! The entire movie was shot on two \uc2 Apple\uc2  15 Pro Phones loaded with Filmic Pro. The location sound mix was done by a professional sound crew from Bombay, as everything was shot sync sound with 'real people,' if I can call them that; there was just no way we were going to head to the studios for dubbing! That's pretty much what one can do in a no-budget scenario.\par \par \uc2 Most of the 'actors' in the sequences at the gym are folks who are regulars at 'Blue Ocean.' In particular, may I mention Kajal Thapa, Mohin Khan, and Gulfam Khan for their brilliant performance and cooperation all throughout up until now! Four professional actors from Chandigarh joined us in Dehradun, and it was a blessing to have all of them on board our little bitty film BLUE OCEAN; my heartfelt gratitude to all of them - Abhitej Singh, Suraksha Gaire, Shelly Taneja, and Tajinder Kaur. In addition to all my friends and colleagues who stepped in to perform as actors, to whom I am forever grateful, a special word of gratitude to our specially-abled actor Ambica Chatamba and our child actor Gaurang Chauhan for generously giving us their time and shooting until the wee hours!\par \par \uc2 Film Editor Jiten Borah returned to collaborate on BLUE OCEAN after a gap of almost 6 years. I just felt good and safe with him around; this year marks our 10th year of collaboration, and I am proud of our long-standing creative engagement and association.\par \par \uc2 PD: Could you provide some insights regarding your collaboration with Shellee, a prominent lyricist known for his work on critically acclaimed films such as Dev D and Udta Punjab, in the production of the movie?\par \par \uc2 SB: I have known Shellee for more than two decades now, back from the time when we were 'strugglers,' like they say in Bombay! It has been a remarkable, one-of-a-kind special friendship that has only now come to fruition on the professional front. We are just plain buddies, but don't get me wrong, we could not be more dissimilar in our temperament and dispensation! I have been a maverick all my life, and my journey so far is littered with colossal failures, but once in a lifetime, you run into somebody like Shellee, a deeply empathetic poet who truly understands the human condition, and so do you as well!\par \par \uc2 So, for Shellee to collaborate with me, as I imagine, or vice versa, wasn't some special preparation or setting an agenda with a professional collaborator; we are buddies first, you can't take that reality away and put that in a box - he is a very good listener but knows very well when to ask me to shut up. I am loquacious to no end, which can cut both ways actually. As a film director, your first asset is clarity of thought and expression; your job is to get the best out of your crew. If they are not clear about your larger vision and the big picture, it can land the film in trouble.\par \par \uc2 May I mention that I am not the brooding artist; I am first and foremost a craftsman, and Shellee knows that all too well. So, he is quite critical of my craft at times, which is a real blessing for me. Usually, people close to you shun from telling you that! When he is listening or taking notes about how I want the songs done in terms of content (as in BLUE OCEAN), Shellee, as the lyricist, first makes me listen to his initial writings, although I am not always patient, I must say that! Thereafter, once a rough draft is ready, I listen to bits and pieces until the time it's all put together.\par \par \uc2 Actually, it was a great pleasure and a learning experience collaborating with Shellee on BLUE OCEAN. The fertile exchange of ideas culminated in the Punjabi song 'Kih Dassan Main Kaun Hai Thagda' (Is the World Playing games with me, Or am I the one Playing Games with this World?), 'Sach hai Chupp Tey Jhuth Peya Nachda' (Look around, the Truth is Agonizing in Silence While the Lie Dances in Ecstasy). It was soulfully rendered by Mir Basu Barkat Khan from Pugal, Bikaner. I told Shellee that I need a song for BLUE OCEAN that reflects this reality - The biggest con job is what we do to ourselves! The song is just so deep, powerful, and mind-blowing that when I heard it first, I pretty much went into a trance! It truly encapsulates the psychological condition of Prakash Negi, the undercover cop entrusted with a job to nab a con artist at the foothills of the Himalayas.\par \par \uc2 PD: Will the upcoming movie be a groundbreaking addition to the world of Hindi cinema, challenging the usual norms and going beyond the conventional boundaries?\par \par \uc2 SB: I believe over a period of time, one develops a distinct signature and a clear point of view - camera movements, choice of locations and lenses, choice of actors and non-actors, choice of stories to tell at a particular point in time - all of this reflects that and plays critically into the final product. I cannot make any tall claims about BLUE OCEAN breaking new ground or, as you mentioned, 'going beyond the conventional boundaries.' Each time I make a film, at a fundamental level, I interact with the 'structure' of film, with the twin coordinates of time and space, and organize my resources of sound and picture to tell a hopefully compelling story, linear or non-linear. My peculiar interaction with the 'structure' and the agency it provides me to wrestle with the medium of film while being cognizant of the limitations of the medium is what defines my work as a filmmaker and storyteller.\par \par \uc2 As for the world of Hindi cinema, it's a world unto itself, and I am not privy to it, not all pretty though, as I understand. For me, as a film entrepreneur, putting men, women, and material together is what matters most to me. I am not waiting for someone like Irrfan to walk into my film to be a part of my storytelling; I have to get the job done, I have to get my story out there, star or no star, I couldn't care less. Period. I have no illusions of making something earth-shattering that will alter the course of history; I am just a mere moviemaker at the end of the day. I am glad I don't suffer from megalomania!\par \par \uc2 Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from NORTHEAST NOW.\par \par \uc2 For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in \par \par \uc2 Document NEANOW0020250615el6f0008z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw297\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4455\pichgoal600

No redistribution is permitted. \par \par \uc2 On the Wing A friend in Britain who had just watched a film featuring a British coastal walk, The Salt Path, urged me to see it. He said in his email the hit movie had stunning shots of ospreys.\par \par \uc2 Without sounding like a know-it-all, I had watched the film myself at the State Cinema and was in a position to correct him. The bird, in fact, was a peregrine falcon. But all the same, a bird of prey symbolised freedom and escape for a couple featured in the movie who were on the coastal walk in Dorset, Devon and Cornwell to escape pressures blighting their lives.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo much for trusting AI,\u8221\'20\'1D said my friend, who went on to \uc2 Google\uc2  a natural history of the peregrine from a more reliable source. I was not in a hurry to dismiss artificial intelligence, though. Love it or hate it, AI is rapidly becoming a part of our daily lives, and part of the science of ornithology.\par \par \uc2 The AI computer science that uses machine learning to perform tasks otherwise accomplished by humans is being used to identify, track, and monitor wild birds, among other things.\par \par \uc2 For a few years now, scientists and researchers from around the world have used AI to learn more about the birds around us.\par \par \uc2 In one notable project in the US, under the auspices of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, scientists are using radar sites from 48 American states, along with live weather maps, to analyse bird movements. It then uses AI and machine learning technology to predict when, where and how birds will migrate.\par \par \uc2 Another Cornell Lab creation is designed to recognise birds by their sounds and calls. It is aiding citizen scientists to sift through thousands of bird audio recordings for a library of songs.\par \par \uc2 Data collected from these and other AI-driven projects are helping scientists gain answers to vital questions which include the impact of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change on birds and which species are declining in population. It is helping researchers to better understand not only the health of birds, but ecosystems.\par \par \uc2 Growing reliance on AI is not without problems, however, one being AI-generated \u8220\'20\'1Cnature photography\u8221\'20\'1D. The technology makes it easy to doctor photographs, producing fake images or giving misleading information, as happened with my friend searching for the bird of prey in The Salt Path and coming up with the wrong raptor, a bird that hunts fish along the coast and not birds in the sky. The short history of AI has already thrown up a false image that initially did the rounds on social media as fact and now is circulating in an \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  of ridicule. The 2023 picture was of the \u8220\'20\'1CSanta-cardinal\u8221\'20\'1D, a festive red-and-white bird perched against a snowy landscape. The bird was later revealed as AI generated. It does not exist in nature.\par \par \uc2 Hobart Mercury-20250615-Hobart-61-000493200802 \par \par \uc2 Document MRCURY0020250615el6f00010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw103\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1545\pichgoal600

But a new and recent study reveals that they actually belong to a species never seen before: , the "prince dragon". This medium-sized carnivorous dinosaur helps to understand how the feared tyrannosaurs, such as the , went from being small, agile predators to become the giants that dominated their world.\par \par \uc2 In the early 1970s, two partial skeletons of were found in Mongolia. Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle found these remains and identified them as A, an enigmatic and little-studied species. However, more than 50 years later, a new group of researchers has re-examined these remains and concluded that Perle was wrong and that this animal, which has been the protagonist of movies and stories that paint it as the king, has a much more complex evolutionary history: it was not always giant and invincible.\par \par \uc2 In a new research published in the scientific journal Nature, a group of scientists points out that the remains that Perle found actually belong to a new species of carnivorous dinosaur, baptized as. comes from the Latinization of two Mongolian words: "khankh\u252\'00\'FC\u252\'00\'FC\u252\'00\'FC", which means prince, and "luu", which means dragon. Thus, the name could be translated in English as "dragon prince". This hitherto unknown species represents a missing link in the evolution of large tyrannosaurs such as the , and its finding reconfigures what we knew about the origins of these large predators.\par \par \uc2 "We identified a new species of , an ancestor of the superpredatory tyrannosaurs," summarizes Jared Voris, first author of the paper and a doctoral candidate in the Department of Earth, Energy and \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  at the \uc2 University of Calgary\uc2 , quoted by that institution. Far from being a giant from the start, Khankhuuluu shows, according to the authors of the study, that the ancestors of T. rex were smaller, slender and that their rise to dominance as superpredators was gradual and more complex than previously thought. "Basically, just before they became superpredators, tyrannosaurs were medium-sized, agile predators that lived in the shadows of others," Voris says.\par \par \uc2 was a medium-sized carnivorous dinosaur that lived in what is now Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous period, about 86 million years ago.\par \par \uc2 Scientists identified it thanks to a combination of bone characteristics that differentiate it from other dinosaurs. One of its main peculiarities is that it had a low, rough ridge in the center of the nasal bones, which ran almost its entire length. In addition, it had a small pneumatic cavity - a kind of empty space inside the bone - in the part of the skull where the lacrimal and nasal bones meet.\par \par \uc2 The square bone of the skull (which helps form the jaw) had a unique shape and socket, indicating that the animal had a different skull structure than other close relatives. It weighed 750 kilograms, about the size of a horse, making it two to three times smaller than its huge descendants. It possessed tiny horns that would evolve to become prominent in later species for mating displays and intimidation. it had a long, shallow skull, showing that it could not crush bones like a T. rex.\par \par \uc2 All these features indicate, according to scientists, that it occupies an important place in the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs, representing an intermediate stage between the small ancestors of the group and large predators such as . Something happened to the other non-tyrannosaurian superpredators that drove them to extinction. This opened a door for them to evolve into the giants depicted in movies like . "We've never had a good representation of that transition," Voris explains in the \uc2 University of Calgary\uc2  paper. "This new species gives us a window into the rising stage of tyrannosaurs, just as they are transitioning to superpredator form."\par \par \uc2 The results change what was previously thought about how these dinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous. Asia was the place of origin for intermediate tyrannosauroids, including . Analyses show a 73.2 % probability that the most recent common ancestor of and lived in Asia. Some of these tyrannosauroids then migrated from Asia to North America, where they arose and diversified (such as T. rex) around 86 million years ago. The common ancestor of this group has a 73.6 % probability of having lived in North America. Finally, there was a single return migration from North America to Asia, but later than previously thought.\par \par \uc2 "This shows that these animals moved between North America and Asia," says Voris. "That hasn't changed. We have lots and lots of evidence of patterns like this in wolves, deer and humans, which shows that many of the patterns we observe today occurred in dinosaur times." For Voris, the work is a way to engage the public in the sciences. "Dinosaurs are cool, right?" he says. "It shows people that this is what science does. We use the same methods that \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  scientists and medical professionals use to try to understand how the world works and why things work the way they do."\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250615el6f006co\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

A bar and food will be available into the evening.\par \par \uc2 The Summer Fair will take place at West Buckland Village Hall and on the playing field on Silver Street, from 3pm until late.\par \par \uc2 Monument Probus Club meeting\par \par \uc2 The president, Richard Williams welcomed 29 members to the June meeting of the Monument Probus Club of Wellington, held at the Beambridge Inn, Sampford Arundel.\par \par \uc2 After a brief business session, the president announced the speaker for the morning, club member John Williams and the title of his talk \u8220\'20\'1CThe Most Powerful Man in Hollywood\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Williams revealed that, probably due to a career in journalism, spanning nearly 50 years, he had developed a strong interest in \u8220\'20\'1Cmurder, mystery and mayhem\u8221\'20\'1D. This coupled with a strong background in film and TV journalism had resulted in him researching and compiling his talk.\par \par \uc2 Central to his presentation was the life of Eddie Mannix, one of the most influential and ruthless figures within the \uc2 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\uc2  organisation at a time when the \u8220\'20\'1Cstudio system\u8221\'20\'1D dominated the movie industry \u8211\'20\'13 and its stars \u8211\'20\'13 during the \u8220\'20\'1CGolden Age of Hollywood\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Between the early 1930s and the late 1950s, Mannix effectively took on the role of \uc2 MGM\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1CMr Fixit\u8221\'20\'1D. Together with Howard Strickling, the studio\u8217\'20\'19s manipulative public relations chief, he was instrumental in covering some of the biggest scandals that could have severely damaged the reputation of the company and destroyed the careers of some of its top box office stars.\par \par \uc2 During his illustrated presentation, Mr Williams spoke on a series of sordid incidents in the private lives of such major stars as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Jean Harlow, Loretta Young, Judy Garland and Van Johnson. In each case, by a mixture of blackmail, bribery, physical threats and fake publicity, Mannix and Strickling simply made the crisis disappear, leaving the reputation of the stars and \uc2 MGM\uc2  intact.\par \par \uc2 Following a lively question-and-answer session, Mr Williams was thanked by the president.\par \par \uc2 The next meeting will be at the Beambridge Inn on Thursday, July 3, at the slightly earlier time of 10.45am, when David Ramsden will give a presentation, entitled, \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  Change and the Ecological Crisis \u8211\'20\'13 What\u8217\'20\'19s All the Fuss About?\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Monument Probus Club welcomes new members.

We are pleased that most services are now operated by brand new electric buses which are quieter, cleaner and more comfortable than the old diesel buses. It is the first time for many years that the Taunton area has been provided with new vehicles, so we hope many local people with use them.\par \par \uc2 And also come and find out about the new Wellington to Wiveliscombe and West Buckland service, initially introduced on a trial basis two mornings a week (Tuesday and Thursdays) but we hope that this can be expanded in time.\par \par \uc2 We hope to have timetables to give out on the day but First Bus have printed very few of their all route timetable; however we will have information on all routes serving Wellington.\par \par \uc2 We will be happy to receive feedback to pass on to the bus companies and local politicians.\par \par \uc2 Urgent appeal\par \par \uc2 An urgent appeal has been received from Christian Response to Eastern Europe (cr2ee) for bicycles for all ages.\par \par \uc2 We are aware many Wellington folk support this charity who take aid to Ukraine and Moldova so please get in touch if you have a bike no longer needed and we will collect.\par \par \uc2 Contact David on 07773 579809.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  friendly hopes fall short\par \par \uc2 Residents\u8217\'20\'19 hopes for a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  friendly Wellington by 2025 have fallen short, as their plans, drawn up in 2010, aren\u8217\'20\'19t met.\par \par \uc2 In April 2010, Taunton Deane\u8217\'20\'19s Local Strategic Partnership worked with Taunton\u8217\'20\'19s Transition Town voluntary group to lead a series of workshops to help residents consider the potential impacts of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change on their way of living.\par \par \uc2 The following May, Transition Town Wellington met to discuss the same issue and together, they produced a document envisioning a green, low carbon Wellington for 2025.\par \par \uc2 The groups\u8217\'20\'19 approach in producing this report \u8220\'20\'1Cwasn\u8217\'20\'19t of doom and gloom\u8221\'20\'1D they said, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut to foster a response to the challenges they faced at a community level.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Among their hopes were a local knitting co-op that only used local wool, a Wellington wind farm, composting toilets, a community bartering centre, solar panels on every roof, and horse and cart only parking bays.\par \par \uc2 Also envisioned were changes to legislation, banning bottled water, tumble dryers, and oil and gas central heating, as well as marking the town\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2  efforts with the big \u8220\'20\'1CChristmas switch-off\u8221\'20\'1D, as opposed to the current annual event in Wellington, the Christmas lights switch-on.\par \par \uc2 Despite these short falls, Chairman of Transition Town Wellington, Anita Roy says there have been some successes, including a new fleet of electric buses, a new community farm, and a \u8220\'20\'1Cfabulous\u8221\'20\'1D green corridor.\par \par \uc2 It was also announced this morning (June 12) that the hoped for Wellington railway station has received the go-ahead from Chancellor \uc2 Rachel Reeves\uc2  after the Treasury confirmed that the spending review would provide funding to support its reopening.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wellington-today.co.uk/tindle-static/image/2025/04/15/8/47/IMG_0303.jpeg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Transition Town Wellington\u8217\'20\'19s hopes for a \b  \highlight22climate\b0 \highlight22  friendly Wellington by 2025 have fallen short (Photo: Tindle News)}}}\par \par \uc2 Anita said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis report is a bit of a TARDIS allowing us to time-travel back 15 years to hear what people then thought today's Wellington would look like.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSustainable, resilient, single-use plastic-free, with water harvesting, community composting and loads of locally grown food.

Wells Griffith III, the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change policy adviser to Pres. Trump in his first administration. The year is 2018, the location the \uc2 UN\b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  Summit in Poland, and Goodman is trying to get an answer to what would seem like an appropriate and straightforward question for a senior policy adviser on \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Amy Goodman, host of \u8216\'20\'18Democracy Now!\u8217\'20\'19Democracy Now!}}}\par \par \uc2 After identifying herself and her news outlet, she asks, \u8220\'20\'1CCan you tell us what you think about President Trump saying \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is a hoax?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For over two minutes, through the busy corridors of the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  summit, Goodman politely but persistently attempts to get a response from Griffith, who almost breaks into a sprint to avoid her.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhy not answer a few simple questions?\u8221\'20\'1D she continues before he secrets himself behind a door marked United States of America Delegation Office.\par \par \uc2 Goodman could have used the occasion of the film premiere to laud herself, but instead she directed the focus onto her colleagues at Democracy Now!, her family, and the filmmaking team on stage with her for a Q&A \u8211\'20\'13 directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin, and producer Karen Ranucci.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The DC/DOX Q&A following the premiere of \u8216\'20\'18Steal This Story, Please.\u8217\'20\'19 L-R Moderator Matt Carey, Amy Goodman, director Tia Lessin, producer Karen Ranucci, director Carl DealCourtesy of DC/DOX.

In the film she shares the story of seeking a job on Phil Donohue\u8217\'20\'19s talk show after graduating from college, only to be offered what amounted to a cameo \u8211\'20\'13 appearing on his program as a guest to represent unemployed young people.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Democracy Now!}}}\par \par \uc2 Her journalism career formally began at the Pacifica Radio station in New York \u8211\'20\'13 WBAI. In 1996 she cofounded Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report. \u8220\'20\'1CWe went from nine stations to today over 1,500 public television and radio stations around the country and around the world,\u8221\'20\'1D she told the DC/DOX audience. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd translated into Spanish, our headlines every day on hundreds of stations in Latin America and Europe, in the United States, because it is critical that we break down as many barriers as we can.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lessin \u8211\'20\'13 who along with Carl Deal earned an Oscar nomination for the 2008 documentary feature Trouble the Water \u8211\'20\'13 contributed to Goodman\u8217\'20\'19s reporting in 2000 at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, where Pres. George H.W. Bush was nominated to run for a second term.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo sooner did I show up than someone put a lanyard around my neck, a press credential, and a camera in my hand. And I was off chasing Amy. And we actually wanted to call this film Chasing Amy, but the title was taken,\u8221\'20\'1D Lessin joked. \u8220\'20\'1CIn the film\u8230\'20\'26 you might remember George Bush Sr. coming down the stairs with Barbara [Bush] and Amy stops him. And the question she asks is, \u8216\'20\'18What do you say to people who call you a war criminal for the Gulf War?\u8217\'20\'19 \u8230\'20\'26I captured it except I looked at my camera as Amy\u8217\'20\'19s having this exchange, and I realized the camera mic was overridden by a mic that I had put on top and we were getting no audio. And so they had this exchange and then Bush walks away, and I have to tell Amy there\u8217\'20\'19s no audio. And without hesitating, she said, \u8216\'20\'18Well, let\u8217\'20\'19s do it again.\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lessin continued, \u8220\'20\'1CShe went down the hall and we went around and then [Bush] came up and then down [the stairs] again and [Amy] asked him the same question. He answered it the same way.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 L-R, Director Carl Deal, Amy Goodman, director Tia LessinCourtesy of DC/DOX. Photo by Joe Goldberg}}}\par \par \uc2 Lessin said the anecdote illustrates Goodan\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cfocus and her persistence, and she\u8217\'20\'19s not going to get a little technical glitch in the way of reporting the truth. And she also was really kind to me, and I saw that kindness reflected in the work she did with her team. I saw it in the footage that she shared with us. I saw it every day.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Democracy Now! is completely funded by viewers, listeners, and foundations and doesn\u8217\'20\'19t accept corporate or government money or advertising. Goodman has reported in the field from Nigeria where she investigated \uc2 Chevron\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s alleged complicity in the brutal suppression of protests by local people impacted by the company\u8217\'20\'19s oil exploration. She reported from Haiti, Peru, and in 1997 risked her life to report from East Timor, where Indonesian troops opened fire on Timorese, killing 270 people. Goodman and a journalism colleague writing for The New Yorker were beaten by gun-toting Indonesian soldiers (their weapons, as she pointed out, supplied by the U.S.).\par \par \uc2 Today, she has become not just admired and respected but beloved by an audience that gravitates to her moral compass, which points toward truth to be uncovered where many news outlets fail to look \u8211\'20\'13 in the streets, with the people.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s that global audience hungry for authentic voices, not your typical pundits who know so little about so much, explaining the world to us and getting it so wrong,\u8221\'20\'1D Goodman noted. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s how the corporate media covers issues. They go right away to the politicians. But what pushes them [politicians]? What changes their minds? What is the reason that they pass bills? It is that engine of grassroots activism that is the true story of history that is so often untold, and it is our job in the media to put that on the record.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the film, Democracy Now!\u8217\'20\'19s Nermeen Shaikh says it\u8217\'20\'19s about widening the frame of new coverage to center those kept at the margins or ignored by traditional media. Referring to groups often cropped out by the largest and most lucrative media entities, Goodman commented, \u8220\'20\'1CI do think that those who care about war and peace, those who care about human rights, about inequality, those who care about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , about LGBTQ issues, about racial justice, economic justice are not a fringe minority, not even a silent majority, but the silenced majority \u8212\'20\'14 silenced by the corporate media \u8212\'20\'14 which is why we have to [report] the facts.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The DC/DOX audience attending a Q&A after the premiere of \u8216\'20\'18Steal This Story, Please!\u8217\'20\'19Courtesy of DC/DOX. Photo by Carolina Kroon}}}\par \par \uc2 As the moderator of the panel, I asked Goodman if she considered herself an unlikely rock star of journalism. She wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t bite on that inquiry, but producer Karen Ranucci spoke to the Goodman effect.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen I walk down the street with Amy, people are stopping her all the time, thanking her,\u8221\'20\'1D Ranucci shared. \u8220\'20\'1CAt all the protests or whatever she\u8217\'20\'19s filming, people are coming up and thanking. And that\u8217\'20\'19s such an odd thing to thank a journalist and it\u8217\'20\'19s for showing up and it\u8217\'20\'19s love. They call her \u8216\'20\'18Amy,\u8217\'20\'19 and it\u8217\'20\'19s like this affection. So, for me, it is really thrilling to feel that coming from the public, they\u8217\'20\'19re so appreciative.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ranucci added, \u8220\'20\'1CAs far as myself being a producer, yes, we wanted to make this for the general public to turn people onto Democracy Now! for them to understand why independent media is critical in a democracy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As tanks threaten to symbolically crush American democracy in an unprecedented display of militarism and authoritarian-style politics in the capital, Goodman and Democracy Now! can be counted on to document not just that telegenic spectacle, but the heart of resistance in the streets, across America.\par \par \uc2 Deal said he was struck by how different the approach of Goodman and Democracy Now! is to covering stories of this magnitude after he watched CNN report on the ICE protests in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey had three reporters on the ground in the middle of these protests, and they were describing what was happening and then they\u8217\'20\'19d go to a studio interview, and they didn\u8217\'20\'19t talk to a single person who was out there, and you had no idea why people were there,\u8221\'20\'1D Deal said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was like a big a-ha thing of you need to go to this school of Amy Goodman. It really did help me understand\u8230\'20\'26 having seen Amy and watched Amy and sat with her for so many months, how important it is to listen, to let people say why they\u8217\'20\'19re doing what they\u8217\'20\'19re doing and to understand it. The whole film for us was in dialogue with the world we\u8217\'20\'19re living in today.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Amy-Goodman-Steal-This-Story-premiere.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Amy Goodman (wearing 'Democracy Now!' hat) attends the world premiere of 'Steal This Story, Please!' in Washington DC.

An avowed movie lover, Zeca and his band entertained the audience with the main hits from his successful 28-year musical career. Before taking the stage, in a conversation with journalists, the Maranh\u227\'00\'E3o native expressed his concern about the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  and environmental emergency facing the country and the world.\par \par \uc2 "People think that these are alarmist views, but we know that there are scientists studying this whole situation in the world today and we know that this is critical. It's only a matter of time. So, any call that can be made to summon people, even if only to think, to reflect on the issue, is welcome. And combining this with culture, in this case a film and video festival, specifically focused on the environmental issue, makes this alert more playful," he said.\par \par \uc2 Related news: SP: The Book Fair starts this Saturday at Pacaembu. TV Brasil launches mini-documentary on betting . Korean Film Festival brings 22 productions to S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo.\par \par \uc2 Baleiro classifies the country's political, social and environmental situation as a state of "great ebullience", in which it is necessary to seek a convergence of people for a common good. "I think we're living in a new 1960s decade, a moment when an era is changing, moving on to a new historical level," he observed.\par \par \uc2 "So, all of these issues that are being raised at the moment need to be debated and if we can do this in an \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  of culture, of art, that's even better, because you attract people who, a priori, might not be interested in that," he added.\par \par \uc2 Considered the biggest environmentally-themed audiovisual event in Latin America, Fica brings together competitive film screenings, workshops, cultural attractions, environmental activities, sessions for children and musical shows, as well as forums and debates with big names in national and international cinema. Among the personalities present are environmentalist, writer and indigenous leader A\u237\'00\'EDlton Krenak and filmmakers Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Moreira Salles and Vincent Carelli.\par \par \uc2 Passion for cinema During the interview, Zeca Baleiro also revealed his love of cinema. "For me, it's like going to mass, then the lights go out, the trailer comes on and everything goes silent. I think it's nice, a ritual we can't miss," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry that things like \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and subscription channels, although important, sometimes end up stealing the public away from the cinema, but it's good that we're in a good moment for national cinema now, people are coming back to the cinemas and everything," he said.\par \par \uc2 The singer composes soundtracks for theater and film, including a recent work on a documentary about the Krah\u244\'00\'F4 indigenous people based on the book by indigenist Fernando Schiavini.\par \par \uc2 Zeca Baleiro's show at the 26th edition of the International Environmental Film and Video Festival (Fica 2025), with the theme "Cerrado: the Brazilian savannah and the balance of the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 " Jo\u233\'00\'E9dson Alves/Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil Transformations in music Almost three decades into his career, Zeca Baleiro also reflected on the structural changes in the music market since then, especially the impact caused by platforms. "Today it's very difficult to publicize the most recent things, because there's a lot of pulverization with digital platforms and there are so many releases every day." Next year, when he turns 60, the Maranh\u227\'00\'E3o native plans to release a memoir to tell everything he has seen and experienced on the Brazilian music scene during this period.\par \par \uc2 "Today, for example, I find it much more difficult to start a career. I know a lot of talented new artists who find it very difficult to think about a long-term career. My generation still managed to do this because we had a little bit of the graphic phonographic market, when there was still physical support," he said.\par \par \uc2 "On the other hand, it's very simple for someone in Goi\u225\'00\'E1s or the interior of Pernambuco to record something and put it on the internet. There's nothing to stop him, it doesn't matter if he sings well, if he plays well, if he composes well. He has that freedom. There's no curation, no rigor. So, there are things that have advanced, there are things that have improved, there are things that have worsened and so life goes on," he added.\par \par \uc2 *The Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil reporting team travelled at the invitation of the 26th Fica organization.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250614el6e008he\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw281\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4215\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last month, Uganda staged its first-ever immersive virtual reality film that showcases the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s unique bond with nature and their role as original conservationists. The film made its local premier. Directed by the visionary duo Emmanuel Rukundo and Lorna Okeng Atim, Keepers of The Forest: The Batwa Legacy dives into indigenous wisdom, \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and the magic of immersive storytelling of the Batwa people, who once dwelled in the vast Bwindi and Virunga Mountain ranges. For generations, they lived in balance with nature with their traditions deeply rooted in \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This was before they were displaced by the government to make way for the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, and Mgahinga National Park in south western Uganda.\par \par \uc2 The film explores the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s symbiotic relationship with Mother Earth, nature, and the majestic mountain gorillas, and their ancestral role as conservationists of one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest carbon sinks. It celebrates the Batwa as conservationists of these ecological systems that balance the global \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The film brings an important and urgent narrative at the intersection of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, indigenous knowledge, intangible heritage, and \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The project highlights the symbiotic relationship between indigenous communities and nature, emphasising sustainable practices that can guide global efforts to combat \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, especially since Africa stores 23 percent of the world\u8217\'20\'19s carbon in forest biomass.\par \par \uc2 Using interactive storytelling, Atim and Rukundo invite the audience to experience the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s deep connection with the forest, their resilience in the face of adversity, and their historical role as original conservationists. Guided by the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s philosophies and vernacular algorithms, this 15-minute VR experience\u8212\'20\'14compatible with Meta Quest 2 and 3 headsets\u8212\'20\'14merges oral traditions with modern technology. Through spatial audio and first-person immersion, the film takes viewers on a sensory journey that celebrates the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s ecological wisdom while spotlighting the urgent threats to their way of life. The 2025 production by Keepers XR (Uganda) was supported by the French Embassy in Uganda and the SPICE Project. Selected for the prestigious New Images Festival in Paris, the 15-minute film is making waves on the global stage.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Batwa conserved the Bwindi and Virunga Mountain forests (one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest carbon sinkers) through a symbiotic relationship with nature, built on deep spiritual, ecological, and cultural ties to the land. Their survival was interwoven with the wellbeing of the forest. The Batwa didn\u8217\'20\'19t \u8220\'20\'1Cconserve\u8221\'20\'1D the forest in the way modern systems define it. They simply lived in kinship with it. They understood the moods of trees, the patterns of rain, the migration of animals,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim says. \u8220\'20\'1CTheir laws were unwritten but embedded deeply into memory: take only what you need, leave no harm behind. This wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just a way of life, it was a philosophy of presence, of deep listening, and of respect for non-human beings. Their homesteads, built from leaves and branches, sustainably died back into the soil when no longer needed,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim adds.\par \par \uc2 Preserving knowledge\par \par \uc2 In the 1990s, the Mgahinga and Bwindi forests were protected as national parks by the Government of Uganda (GoU). Atim observes that although the Batwa were displaced from the forests, they have managed to preserve their cultural heritage and knowledge. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd yet, in the name of progress and protection, the Batwa were exiled from the forest they had protected so fiercely. They were told it was no longer their home,\u8221\'20\'1D she notes. Atim struggles to see the wisdom in removing a tree from its roots and expect it to forget the soil. Despite displacement, the Batwa preserve their knowledge through oral storytelling, communal memory, and cultural practices that are passed down generations. \u8220\'20\'1CEven in displacement, the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s knowledge did not die, it adapted. Elders still speak the old stories. Children still hear the names of trees and the wisdom of the winds.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to the government and \uc2 Uganda Wildlife Authority\uc2 , the Batwa are now the guides of the forests, taking tourists on these journeys through Mgahinga National Park, giving travellers an intimate first-hand experience of what sacred conservational practices look like,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim says. \u8220\'20\'1CNow, through new tools like virtual reality, their memories are reawakened and shared, allowing the world to walk through the forests as they once did. Through the Keepers of the Forest: The Batwa Legacy film, we\u8217\'20\'19re using immersive technologies such as VR to (re)create and share their worldview, helping to document and disseminate their ecological wisdom in new formats. This blending of tradition and technology enables them to maintain and share their identity and \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  ethics even in exile. Cultural revival, youth-led storytelling, and partnerships with \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and digital media efforts support this continuity,\u8221\'20\'1D she adds.\par \par \uc2 With the world, especially countries in the Global South like Uganda, grappling with a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis, Atim reckons that there are several lessons to pick from the Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s lived experiences. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are indeed living in unprecedented times. El Nino rains are causing floods and ravaging gardens across Uganda and Africa. Ninety-two percent of Ugandans are subsistence farmers who depend entirely on favourable weather conditions to cultivate their crops as their primary source of sustenance. The floods and dry spells mean increased food insecurity and prolonged hunger,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. She adds: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a lesson here, as the earth warms and the storms grow fiercer. The Batwa remind us that \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is not simply about carbon credits or protected zones, it\u8217\'20\'19s about relationships. It\u8217\'20\'19s about seeing the world not as a warehouse of resources, but as a living web of relations.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ethic of reciprocity\par \par \uc2 Atim says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe can borrow their ethic of reciprocity, their intuitive grasp of balance. We can learn to listen again, to the land, to those who have known it longest. We can stop treating indigenous communities as relics of the past and start recognising them as guides for the future. From the Batwa, we can borrow a vital shift in mindset, one that sees humanity not as separate from nature, but as part of its intricate weave. Their way of life teaches us to live with nature, not against it, embracing \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  as a communal, relational practice grounded in respect and interdependence.\u8221\'20\'1D She adds: \u8220\'20\'1CBy valuing intangible heritage as a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  intelligence, we begin to see traditional ecological knowledge not as outdated, but as deeply contextual, time-tested, and essential for \b \highlight22\uc2 sustainability\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Batwa remind us that indigenous wisdom must be integrated into modern \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  strategies, especially in managing forests and biodiversity, not as an afterthought, but as a guiding framework. Most importantly, they urge us to co-create with indigenous communities, recognising them not merely as stakeholders, but as experts, custodians, and co-authors of our shared environmental future. In their legacy, we find a profound truth: \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is not only science, it is culture, connection, and care.\u8221\'20\'1D Africa, despite facing the harshest consequences of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change, yet contributing minimally to global emissions, holds 23 percent of the world\u8217\'20\'19s carbon in forest biomass.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis intensifies with devastating effects on vulnerable regions, especially Africa. The film sheds light on the crucial role of indigenous communities, specifically the Batwa people, an endangered group with a population of 6,700 in Uganda, in providing alternative solutions for \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and fostering sustainable coexistence with nature,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim observes. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an important, urgent and timely story, how indigenous knowledge systems used for centuries in Africa, particularly in Uganda, can influence the way Africa and the world approach solutions to reverse the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis.\par \par \uc2 The immersive film amplifies the impact of alternative \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , sustainable practices and cultural preservation to encourage a paradigm shift in how society views \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 , indigenous cultures, intangible heritage, and the critical need for sustainable practices,\u8221\'20\'1D she added. For her, there is a lot to learn from the keepers of the forest\u8212\'20\'14their memory, their resilience, their way of life. \u8220\'20\'1CTheir legacy,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim says of the Batwa, \u8220\'20\'1Cis not lost. It is still being told, through stories, through song, and now, through the immersive lens of technology, drawing the world into their forest once more.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Scientific knowledge\par \par \uc2 The Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s scientific knowledge, gleaned from living within the forest\u8217\'20\'19s limits, has been passed down through generations. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Batwa\u8217\'20\'19s indigenous knowledge included oral traditions, spiritual practices, and ecological wisdom that regulate how, when, and what resources can be used. This intangible heritage was captured in non-traditional formats of documentations such as songs, rituals, hunting and foraging techniques, and community laws that align human behaviour with forest rhythms,\u8221\'20\'1D Atim notes. \u8220\'20\'1CTheir \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  is non-extractive and holistic ideologies (a language now echoed in multiple contemporary sub-cultures as sustainable and green living) built on mutual respect between humans, animals, and plants.\par \par \uc2 For example, they understand plant medicine, animal migration, and how to avoid disrupting key species. Their approach embodies circularity and reciprocity, seeing nature not as a resource to conquer but a relative to protect,\u8221\'20\'1D she adds. Atim also talks about the \u8220\'20\'1Cvernacular code\u8221\'20\'1D the Batwa are famed for. It is \u8220\'20\'1Ca way of knowing that merges ecological understanding with cultural identity.\u8221\'20\'1D In every plant, there is a name and a purpose. And in every animal, a spirit and a warning. \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  was not a job, it was a song, a prayer, a way to be whole. Their heritage is a living archive of balance between taking and giving, between humans and the non-human world. They didn\u8217\'20\'19t build fences to protect nature, they instead built and respected non-human relationships,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 Stay updated by following our WhatsApp and Telegram channels;\par \par \uc2 Daily Monitor Telegram channel\par \par \uc2 Daily Monitor WhatsApp Channel\par \par \uc2 Document DAYMO00020250614el6e0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc85}{\*\bkmkend toc85}\b \uc2 Animal Nature Future Film Festival; Cannes Premiere: ANFFF 2025 Unveils 'Resonance of Nature' Through Multisensory Eco-Cinema\b0\par\par\uc2 584 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 June 2025\par \uc2 Ecology, Environment & Conservation\par \uc2 ECECON\par 79\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 Copyright 2025 Ecology, Environment & Conservation via VerticalNews.com \par \par \uc2 2025 JUN 13 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology, \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  & \b \highlight22\uc2 Conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- On May 21st at Marche du Film, Festival de Cannes, the Animal Nature Future Film Festival (ANFFF), presented by UK non-profit INB CIC, debuted its 2025 theme initiative: Resonance of Nature: Bond of Life. The program features six short films from the UK, US, and China, exploring intricate relationships between humans, animals, and ecosystems. Through narrative, ecological performance, and hybrid documentary, these works reflect the festival's commitment to cinematic storytelling as a catalyst for environmental awareness and cross-cultural dialogue.\par \par \uc2 The theme film of ANFFF 2025 has been specially commissioned by director Yangyang Shao, and features rising star actress Yulingqiao Zhang. Rooted in the five human senses and their intricate connection to nature and urban life, the film explores the emotional and sensory relationship between the body and its \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Through Xiang Zhang's visually arresting work-seamlessly transitioning between black-and-white and color-the film combines montage editing and an evocative score by international composers Weichen Lin, William Qi, and Han Bao to create an immersive, multisensory journey back to nature.\par \par \uc2 The film's producer and ANFFF founder Kean Cao describes it as "a breathing visual poem". As the concept film for the new edition of the festival, she hopes it will resonate with audiences across cultures-inviting them to pause, step away from the noise of daily life, and rediscover the quiet, flowing energy of the natural world.\par \par \uc2 The program features five additional films spanning science, memory, and \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  futures. Immaculate, created by BBC science researcher Ningjing Wang, follows a passionate scientist's quest to save the rare spotless tree frog-earning a BAFTA Student Award nomination and Best Young Filmmaker at ANFFF 2024. A Letter from a Rose documents 200 years of botanical history, born from director Long Jing's five-year collaboration with nature in Shanghai. Zhikun Zhang's Spring Once More portrays a father's inner awakening during his wife's second childbirth. NURA, a WeShort Original, tells the story of a woman navigating survival in a \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 -collapsed world. Antigone (Modern) by Uriah Jiang & Sino-US directors, reimagines the Greek tragedy with Stella Adler youth, challenging human hubris against nature.\par \par \uc2 Following the screening, audience members shared reflections. Viewer Paolo praised the films' cross-cultural insights. Georgia aligned with ANFFF's mission, and was moved by the real-world ecological impact these films represent - raising awareness and protecting endangered species. She hopes to bring these stories to audiences in her own country.\par \par \uc2 WeShort CEO Alex Loprieno signed a long-term screening and distribution partnership with ANFFF during the event, solidifying their shared mission to advance ecological cinema globally. Through this collaboration, they will support the market growth and international circulation of environmentally focused films, empowering filmmakers to engage with pressing ecological narratives.\par \par \uc2 Building on this vision, ANFFF invites curators worldwide to its platform, leveraging localized screenings and community engagement to amplify ecological and animal protection-story by story, region by region.\par \par \uc2 Official Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.anfff.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.anfff.org}}}\par \par \uc2 Email: info@internationalnaturebond.com\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=EN95974&Transmission_Id=202505261053PR_NEWS_EURO_ND__EN95974&DateId=20250526"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=EN95974&Transmission_Id=202505261053PR_NEWS_EURO_ND__EN95974&DateId=20250526}}}\par \par \uc2 SOURCE Animal Nature Future Film Festival\par \par \uc2 Keywords for this news article include: Ecology, Animal Nature Future Film Festival.\par \par \uc2 Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

For the second year running, the Children's Forum of the International Environmental Film and Video Festival (Fica) has mobilized hundreds of 5th grade students in the historic city of Goi\u225\'00\'E1s, 140 kilometers from Goi\u226\'00\'E2nia.\par \par \uc2 The activities, which take place over the course of months until culminating in the festival, involve fun workshops, ecological actions and the formulation of proposals. One of these initiatives resulted in the children writing a letter to the local and state authorities.\par \par \uc2 Related news: Sesc S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo has a special program for \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Week. Society will discuss 100 proposals at an environmental conference. Indigenous children deliver manifesto for the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  to ministers.\par \par \uc2 With several demands, the letter is encapsulated in the Cine Teatro S\u227\'00\'E3o Joaquim and will be reopened in 25 years' time to see what progress has been made since then.\par \par \uc2 "It's a time for listening. The authorities stop to listen to the children and it's their moment to speak. It's been a wonderful experience. I was very surprised by the level of the children's debate when they talked about the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , deforestation, burning and requests for monitoring," said the forum's coordinator, Professor ngela Oliveira, during the parade in defense of the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the cerrado, on Thursday morning (12). The march went through the main streets of the historic center of the former capital of Goi\u225\'00\'E1s, bringing together around 270 children in the 10-year-old age group.\par \par \uc2 >> Follow Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Sustainable values Following the Children's Forum, which became part of Fica's official program, the Esperan\u231\'00\'E7ar Committee was set up to promote concrete measures to commit the city to sustainable values.\par \par \uc2 One of these measures is Bill No. 13/2025, proposed by students from the Children's Forum at Fica in 2024, which restricts the free distribution of plastic bags in local shops and proposes educational actions on the environmental impacts caused by these materials.\par \par \uc2 "There's a whole symbolism to this action because it's much easier to work for the future with children, as they are already growing up with this environmental awareness, of belonging to a common place that needs to be looked after, which is our planet," explains Mayor Aderson Liberato Gouveia.\par \par \uc2 Last month, just a few weeks before Fica 2025, the bill was debated at a public hearing in the Goi\u225\'00\'E1s City Council. On that occasion, representatives of civil society, traders and students took an active part in the debate. Although they showed concern about the logistical impacts of the proposal, the business sectors recognized the importance of sustainable measures and environmental education as a path to lasting change.\par \par \uc2 "I learned that plastic bags, which many of us use in supermarkets, take 400 to 1,000 years to decompose in the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," says Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Gabriel Costa Dias da Luz, 10, a 5th grade student at a school in the city's S\u227\'00\'E3o Jos\u233\'00\'E9 neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 The International Environmental Film and Video Festival changes the city's routine - Photo: Vinicius Schmidt/Secult-GO A member of the Children's Forum, Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Gabriel is clear about the role of children in this scenario of transforming the planet. "Children are the future of the world. And by knowing more and more, they will be able to know how to take care of our world and not let it be destroyed. Taking care of the Cerrado is taking care of ourselves," says Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Gabriel.\par \par \uc2 Lasting legacies In addition to the debate to restrict the use of plastic bags, now in 2025 the children are focusing on proposals to preserve the local fauna and flora. One of the challenges, for example, is to complete the depollution of the iconic Vermelho River, the same river that is the protagonist of Cora Coralina's verses and crosses the entire urban area of the city. According to the mayor, community mobilization around the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  has helped to give substance to this type of demand and, by 2027, the city council promises, in partnership with the state government, to close all the points where sewage is dumped into the river.\par \par \uc2 For Pedro Novaes, Fica's director of programming, the Children's Forum reflects a concern of the festival that goes beyond the event itself.\par \par \uc2 "The city can't just be a stage for the festival and I think that the festival itself, over the years, has been able to listen to this, to mature this view and this relationship with the city. Now, the festival is trying to engage in the broadest and deepest possible dialog with the city, with lasting impacts, as is the case with the Children's Forum on \b \highlight22\uc2 Climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  Change," he says.\par \par \uc2 Until next Sunday (15), the City of Goi\u225\'00\'E1s will once again be the stage for Fica, which is considered the largest environmentally-themed audiovisual event in Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Competitive film shows The festival brings together competitive film screenings, workshops, cultural attractions, environmental activities, sessions for children and musical shows, as well as forums and debates with big names in national and international cinema.\par \par \uc2 Among the personalities present are environmentalist, writer and indigenous leader Ailton Krenak and filmmakers Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Moreira Salles and Vincent Carelli.\par \par \uc2 In all, 30 short and medium-length films and 12 feature-length works are competing for the awards. One of the novelties of this edition is the creation of the Indigenous and Traditional Peoples Forum.\par \par \uc2 Among the musical attractions, Fica 2025 will feature concerts by singers Zeca Baleiro, Mart'N\u225\'00\'E1lia and the band Os Paralamas do Sucesso. The entire program is free.\par \par \uc2 *The Ag\u234\'00\'EAncia Brasil reporting team travelled at the invitation of the 26th Fica organization.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250613el6d00afq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw109\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1635\pichgoal600

Email us at <a href="mailto:changebydegrees@theguardian.com">changebydegrees@theguardian.com</a>\par \par \uc2 Although it\u8217\'20\'19s unfair, it\u8217\'20\'19s young people (and the generations to come) who will have to deal with fallout from the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis. So how do you talk to young people about living sustainably and raise knowledgeable kids who care about the future of the planet?\par \par \uc2 Here are some tips for engaging the next generation on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  meaningfully.\par \par \uc2 Start with conversation: get curious and stay positive\par \par \uc2 Damon Gameau, film-maker and director of documentaries including 2040 and the upcoming Future Council, says we have built a system that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t value nature \u8211\'20\'13 and that needs to change. \u8220\'20\'1CVery quickly, children aren\u8217\'20\'19t encouraged to care. They\u8217\'20\'19re encouraged to try and extract and conquer and win and compete.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Instilling care and empathy in children works in a similar way to teaching them most other things: through modelling, education and good conversations. <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">\par \par \uc2 Related: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/12/plan-your-menu-get-kids-involved-and-be-realistic-how-to-pack-better-school-lunches"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Plan your menu, get kids involved and be realistic: how to pack better school lunches}}}\uc2  </aside>\par \par \uc2 Susy Lee, author of Raising Kids Who Care and an educator with 18 years\u8217\'20\'19 experience, says the first step is being intentional about what you\u8217\'20\'19re trying to teach. \u8220\'20\'1CWe need kids who know [that they] don\u8217\'20\'19t need to be suckered into buying more stuff [and] that generosity and compassion and helping others is actually what makes them happy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Good conversations need two things, she says: curiosity and positivity. Don\u8217\'20\'19t lecture, be collaborative and be guided by questions. Listen more, talk less.\par \par \uc2 Involving kids in age-appropriate discussions about what matters, then modelling good choices, leads to positive outcomes. Some starting points are: discussing where to donate money and time, whether to get an electric vehicle or petrol car, or visiting your local MP to raise issues important to your community.\par \par \uc2 Gameau says adults can also help by acknowledging the size and scariness of the issues, and letting kids feel anger, sadness and fear. Young people already know about the threats, he says, pointing to an international survey that found {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 nearly 60% of young people}}}\uc2  were either very or extremely worried about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Connect with nature\par \par \uc2 Then connect kids (and adults!) with the living world again: spend time in nature, get to know the bird varieties and tree species around you, have adventures outside. It\u8217\'20\'19s easier to care about things you know, see and experience. Take the time to stop, examine and discuss. Seek out joy, beauty and fun to counterbalance the gloom.\par \par \uc2 Zena Burgess, CEO of the Australian Psychological Society, emphasises the importance of action and taking individual steps that build a community of people making positive progress. This is echoed by Lee and Gameau, and reflects Bob Brown\u8217\'20\'19s catchphrase: action is the antidote to despair.\par \par \uc2 Start where your kids are. If they love the ocean, take them snorkelling, watch documentaries, pick up rubbish on the beach. Look for ways to reduce plastic in the home and community, join campaigns against single-use plastic. Follow the children\u8217\'20\'19s lead, show them hope and possibilities, and steer clear of overwhelm. <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">\par \par \uc2 Related: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/22/how-to-plan-have-a-waste-free-birthday-party-supplies-no-balloons-plastic-toys"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ditch the balloons and swap the plastic toys for cake: how to have a waste-free birthday party }}}\uc2  </aside>\par \par \uc2 Take action \u8211\'20\'13 and don\u8217\'20\'19t forget to have fun\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s not the kids\u8217\'20\'19 responsibility to fix things, it\u8217\'20\'19s ours. But we can support them, combining their ideas, creativity and passion with our knowledge and experience. This help ranges from having good conversations to dealing with emotions, arranging logistics, finding information and joining organisations. And it extends beyond our own children: we\u8217\'20\'19ll all be affected by the future we\u8217\'20\'19ve created, and need to use our skills and connections to make a difference in any way we can.\par \par \uc2 Look for ways to make it fun. Jump in the surf after you\u8217\'20\'19ve cleaned the beach; revel in your results. You\u8217\'20\'19re joining a community of billions of people taking action across the world. Spread the hope and joy of these stories; seek out the positives. Make sure there\u8217\'20\'19s a clear link between doing good and feeling good and make it something others want to join. Make it cool to care.\par \par \uc2 Raising kids who care is a matter of balancing the truth of where we are with the resilience of both the natural world and human endeavour. As Gameau says, \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s something beautiful about the human spirit, particularly when its back is against the wall and innovation and creativity get unleashed. We\u8217\'20\'19re capable of doing extraordinary and wonderful things.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document GRDN000020250606el66002bg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw73\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1095\pichgoal600

The series, produced by the \uc2 Aga Khan University\uc2  and the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, seeks to amplify the voices of those most affected by environmental changes, with the new season airing in late 2025.\par \par \uc2 The series will traverse diverse landscapes from the Pamir mountains in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan's glaciers to Pakistan's salt ranges and Nepal's forests and rivers, covering regions across Pakistan, India, Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. VRW aims to showcase how \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change is reshaping these areas and how local communities are responding through resilience and innovation.\par \par \uc2 VRW has garnered international recognition, receiving 18 awards, including the John B. Oakes Award for Distinguished Reporting on the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Yugo BAFTA Student Film Award. Its episodes have been featured at over 50 international film festivals and broadcast on major networks such as Al Jazeera and PBS Charlotte.\par \par \uc2 The series is supported by the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other benefactors. \uc2 AKU\uc2  President Sulaiman Shahabuddin expressed gratitude for the support, emphasizing the importance of these stories in inspiring action against \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change.\par \par \uc2 Executive Producer Andrew Tkach highlighted the initiative's role in mentoring local filmmakers, particularly women, to raise awareness about the \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  crisis affecting their regions. The series seeks to inform and engage policymakers, business leaders, and the public on environmental issues.\par \par \uc2 Document PAPRIN0020250612el6c001dr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw98\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1470\pichgoal600

The initiative, led by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4447546-1&h=3034500337&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcommercial.justvertical.com%2F&a=Just+Vertical"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Just Vertical}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4447546-1&h=2912487551&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalmedic.ca%2F&a=GlobalMedic"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 GlobalMedic}}}\uc2 , marks the first time hydroponic technology has been deployed for humanitarian aid in the region.\par \par \uc2 Conflict, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and economic instability have made it increasingly difficult for communities to access fresh food.\par \par \uc2 The farm, which is able to grow more than 1,000 plants at once, is now fully operational, providing year-round access to fresh, culturally significant crops in an area where farming is restricted by extreme \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  conditions.\par \par \uc2 Located in Eastern Europe, Moldova borders Ukraine and Romania. While historically an agricultural nation, the country faces harsh winters, economic constraints, security concerns, and logistical disruptions that make the supply of fresh produce almost impossible throughout the year. Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, over 1.9 million Ukrainian citizens have passed through Moldova, with around 127,000 currently residing in the country. This influx has significantly increased the demand for food and resources in stressed and vulnerable communities. This project provides an immediate food security solution while demonstrating how indoor farming technology can be applied in long-term humanitarian efforts.\par \par \uc2 Award-Winning Documentary Captures the Impact\par \par \uc2 A short documentary chronicling the project\u8212\'20\'14"Moldova Feeds," directed by Just Vertical's Conner Tidd and Christopher Di Grazia\u8212\'20\'14was recently awarded Best Short Documentary \u8211\'20\'13 Advertising at the 2025 Niagara Canada International Film Festival. The film features powerful visuals and first-person accounts of the farm's development, community impact, and refugee support. It was edited by Andrew King, a Toronto-based video editor with more than 15 years of experience in reality and non-scripted television in both Australia and North America. King's past work earned him a Canadian Screen Award nomination.\par \par \uc2 Quotes\par \par \uc2 "Conflict, \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and economic instability have made it increasingly difficult for communities to access fresh food," said Conner Tidd, co-founder and CEO of Just Vertical. "By implementing hydroponic technology in Moldova, we're giving people the tools to grow their own food\u8212\'20\'14helping to create long-term stability in an unpredictable world."\par \par \uc2 "Food insecurity isn't just about access\u8212\'20\'14it's about control," said Rahul Singh, executive director of GlobalMedic. "In Moldova, families who fled the war in Ukraine are trying to rebuild their lives while local communities face the strain of supporting them. This project ensures that refugees and their hosts have a sustainable, local food source, reducing dependence on unstable supply chains and foreign aid."\par \par \uc2 Project Highlights\par \par \uc2 * First-of-Its-Kind Humanitarian Hydroponic Farm \u8211\'20\'13 The Moldova farm features 1,024 plant ports, each serving as a dedicated growing site, enabling year-round fresh produce production in a compact, resource-efficient system.\par \par \uc2 * Direct Support for Ukrainian Refugees and Local Communities \u8211\'20\'13 The farm grows culturally significant crops, ensuring the produce aligns with local diets and traditions.\par \par \uc2 * Technology-Driven Resilience \u8211\'20\'13 The green wall system optimizes space and efficiency, allowing communities to grow fresh, pesticide-free produce with minimal inputs.\par \par \uc2 * Award-Winning Storytelling \u8211\'20\'13 The farm's development and human impact are documented in an acclaimed short film, offering a rare window into how Canadian-led innovation is changing lives abroad.\par \par \uc2 * Global Humanitarian Collaboration \u8211\'20\'13 Made possible through a partnership between:\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4447546-1&h=3034500337&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcommercial.justvertical.com%2F&a=Just+Vertical"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Just Vertical}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Provider of indoor farming technology\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4447546-1&h=2912487551&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalmedic.ca%2F&a=GlobalMedic"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 GlobalMedic}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Humanitarian aid partner\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4447546-1&h=3805014323&u=https%3A%2F%2Fkatalyst.md%2F&a=Katalyst+Kitchens"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Katalyst Kitchens}}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Local Moldovan implementation partner\par \par \uc2 * The Myhal Foundation \u8211\'20\'13 Project funder and philanthropic partner\par \par \uc2 * Expanding Impact in Eastern Europe \u8211\'20\'13 This is Just Vertical's first major project in Eastern Europe, setting the stage for future food security initiatives in vulnerable regions.\par \par \uc2 About Just Vertical\par \par \uc2 As the demand for sustainable food production continues to rise, Just Vertical is providing scalable solutions through its cutting-edge indoor vertical hydroponic farming systems.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Paintings by Magritte and others were borrowed for ''The Phoenician Scheme.'' Safeguarding them amid the hot lights and chaos of a film set was challenging.\par \par \uc2 At the end of Wes Anderson's new caper, ''The Phoenician Scheme,'' there are some unusual credits. In addition to the cast and crew, the artworks featured in the film are listed, complete with ownership details. That's because the pieces onscreen are not reproductions. They are in fact the actual masterpieces from Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Ren\u233\'00\'E9 Magritte and other well-known artists.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Anderson has faked a Kandinsky and a Klimt. Here he went for the real thing.\par \par \uc2 ''We have a character who's a collector, who's a possessor; he wants to own things, and we thought because it's sort of art and commerce mixed together this time we should try to have the real thing,'' Anderson said via a voice note.\par \par \uc2 What he ended up with was impressive. The fictional collection of the businessman Zsa-zsa Korda, played by Benicio Del Toro, includes Renoir's ''Enfant Assis en Robe Bleue,'' which was once owned by Greta Garbo, and Magritte's ''The Equator.'' There is also a selection of works from the Hamburger Kunsthalle in Germany that includes pieces from the 17th century.\par \par \uc2 Getting a collector or an art institution to hand over a painting worth millions of dollars to a film production isn't an easy task, and the negotiations fell mostly to Jasper Sharp, a curator who had worked with Anderson and his wife, Juman Malouf, on their 2018 exhibition at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where Sharp is based.\par \par \uc2 ''A film set has vast amounts of light, heat, no \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  control, very lax security, people running everywhere with booms and lights and props,'' Sharp said in a video interview. ''The walls that it will be hung on are made of plywood sometimes. There are less desirable places to hang art, but this was certainly a challenging \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  in terms of me trying to persuade someone that they maybe want to lend an object.''\par \par \uc2 To offset concerns, the production hired a conservator and a registrar to be on set overseeing the paintings. There, in a darkened, fenced-off corner, a security guard watched over the pieces and made sure they would not be exposed to more light than necessary.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt, to have any real conviction in being able to ask somebody to lend an object, we needed to have that sort of support network to assure them that the works would be handled exactly as they were if they were lending them to a museum,'' said Sharp, who explained that this network included insurers, art handlers and shipping services.\par \par \uc2 Still, even with Sharp's connections, some of his initial outreach was met with ''howls'' of laughter and hangups. His search was both creative and practical. After discussing with Anderson what would make sense for Zsa-zsa, a domineering man who prides himself on owning masterpieces, Sharp contacted museums and collectors in the vicinity of the set at \uc2 Studio Babelsberg\uc2  in Potsdam, Germany.\par \par \uc2 Sharp considers the old master selections from the Kunsthalle more in the ''best supporting actor'' category of the art in Zsa-zsa's abode compared with the Renoir or the Magritte, which draw your eye. Anderson said he thought Juriaen Jacobsz's 1678 painting of dogs fighting over meat was ''an encapsulation of part of what our story is about.'' (The film is very much Anderson's exploration of capitalism.)\par \par \uc2 But Zsa-zsa doesn't just collect classical still lifes and paintings of animals. Sharp said he suggested to Anderson that perhaps the character owned some impressive art from the film's period setting -- to show his keen sense of taste, specifically a work of surrealism. Sharp reached out to the collector Ulla Pietzsch, who had never heard of Anderson but was interested in the project.\par \par \uc2 ''I wasn't surprised when Wes settled on Magritte,'' Sharp said. ''If you think about where Wes grew up in Houston, the Menil Collection has, if not the greatest collection of Magrittes in the United States, very close to that. So he has been looking at Magritte for a long time.''\par \par \uc2 Sharp noted that ''The Equator'' is not the most recognizable of Magrittes -- there is no bowler hat -- but it is enigmatic.\par \par \uc2 Anderson, meanwhile, envisioned that a Renoir would hang in the bedroom of Zsa-zsa's daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton). Sharp found one in the collection of David Nahmad.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it was maybe even in the script,'' he said. Knowing that the elder Renoir painted his son Jean as a small child, ''somehow I thought Renoir might have painted somebody in this family, maybe Zsa-zsa.''\par \par \uc2 The loans from Hamburger Kunsthalle remained on set for about a month, but the Magritte was in and out in a day and the Renoir just stayed a night.\par \par \uc2 The production designer Adam Stockhausen said in an email that he and the set decorator Anna Pinnock had full size mock-up prints made to roughly place the art and try multiple positions. ''Once Wes finalized the placements, the conservators brought in the art and we swapped with the mock-ups,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Sharp himself visited the set only once -- the day the Renoir was present -- but he said he felt the stars of the film were deferential to a portrait of Renoir's nephew that they were able to acquire on loan. This revealed itself in a conversation with Del Toro.\par \par \uc2 ''He confessed it made him and everybody quite nervous to have this here, in a good way,'' Sharp said.\par \par \uc2 Observing the dynamic between the stars and the star artwork gave Sharp insight into the reasons Anderson had pursued the actual paintings.\par \par \uc2 ''It changed the energy and the atmosphere on set as it would do if you lived with an object like that,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 As soon as ''The Phoenician Scheme'' wrapped, Sharp started to suspect that it wouldn't be the last time he and Anderson embarked on a project of this nature. Anderson, he said, agreed.\par \par \uc2 ''It's really hard once you've done this for the first time to put it back in the bottle,'' Sharp said.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020250611el6b0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Through candid interviews with leading experts, this film reveals the opportunity beavers create and the unique challenges they introduce in our modern landscapes.\par \par \uc2 The film is narrated by Joanna Lumley and produced by Cornwall-based documentary filmmaker Nina Constable who specialises in \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  and factual storytelling.\par \par \uc2 The second film on the evening, Farming the Flood, is a documentary that follows upland farmers as they implement natural on-farm solutions to manage water, improve soil health and enhance biodiversity.\par \par \uc2 Co-directed by filmmaker Harrison Wood and regenerative farmer Nick Viney, the film highlights how working with natural processes, often funded by government and private grants, can safeguard communities while providing farmers with new sources of income.\par \par \uc2 By focusing on real-world examples, the documentary empowers farmers and landowners with the knowledge and financial resources to become \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  resilience leaders.\par \par \uc2 Nick Viney is a West Devon borough councillor as well as regenerative farmer and independent nature recovery consultant, and co-produced Farming the Flood. She will be on hand to answer questions on the night.\par \par \uc2 The venue is restricted to 60 spaced with entry by free ticket.

But the brilliant minds behind these inspiring solutions cannot do it alone.\par \par \uc2 'They need scaling, support and investment to reach their potential. And they need to be backed by ambitious action on a global, national and local level. Halfway through this decisive decade, I call on all of you to think big in your actions.\par \par \uc2 'Let us act together with urgency and optimism while we still have the chance.\par \par \uc2 'For the future of our planet. For the future generations. We must listen to the words of Sir David Attenborough: 'If we save the sea, we save our world.'\par \par \uc2 A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'There should be no doubt that this speech is The Prince of Wales calling for action to save our oceans now. The world is watching.\par \par \uc2 'This is him using his platform to call for more to be done sooner rather than later.'\par \par \uc2 William was also joined by French President \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2 , Brazil's President \uc2 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\uc2 , Costa Rica's President Rodrigo Chaves Robles and Prince Albert of Monaco.\par \par \uc2 He has previously worked with Albert after joining forces at the Earthshot Summit in 2023.\par \par \uc2 In January, both royals attended the Aston Villa v Monaco Champions League football match - though were supporting opposing sides.\par \par \uc2 As he arrived at the forum, a journalist shouted to the Prince asking whether he was excited to go to Brazil, to which William replied: "Yes".\par \par \uc2 The Forum is organised by the Government of Monaco, the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, and the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, with support from France and Costa Rica.\par \par \uc2 It brings together business leaders, government representatives, multilateral institutions and stakeholders committed to restoring the health of the oceans.\par \par \uc2 The event focuses on ocean preservation and aims to accelerate the transition to a sustainable and regenerative blue economy.\par \par \uc2 During his visit, William met with finalists, winners and key partners of The Earthshot Prize, showcasing innovative solutions that have the power to reverse damage caused to the oceans and preserve it for future generations.\par \par \uc2 Kensington Palace said the finalists and winners had showcased "innovative solutions that have the potential to reverse the damage caused to the oceans and that can preserve it for future generations".\par \par \uc2 William met Sam Teicher from Coral Vita, a 2021 winner, which works to restore coral reefs by growing coral on land to replant in oceans and Jennifer Koepke from \uc2 WildAid\uc2 , a 2023 winner, which scales marine enforcement to end illegal fishing and strengthen ocean \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 William also met 2022 finalist Nick Wilson, whose entry was the Great Bubble Barrier, which works to prevent plastic pollution by intercepting waste before it reaches the ocean, and 2024 finalist Nicholas Hill from Coast 4C, which connects investment in coastal agriculture with \b \highlight22\uc2 conservation\b0 \highlight\uc2  through the farming of regenerative seaweed.\par \par \uc2 Each year five winners are awarded the Earthshot Prize from a shortlist of 15.\par \par \uc2 The BEFF is organised by the government of Monaco, the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, and the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, with support from France and Costa Rica.\par \par \uc2 The forum is a UN Ocean Conference special event and aims to contribute to the implementation of sustainable development goal 14 to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development".\par \par \uc2 France is hosting the UN Ocean Conference from June 9 to June 13 in nearby Nice.\par \par \uc2 The King is due to host Mr Macron on a state visit by the French leader and his wife \uc2 Brigitte Macron\uc2  from July 8-10.\par \par \uc2 The French president will stay at Windsor Castle and be hosted at a state banquet at the historic Berkshire royal residence during his stay.\par \par \uc2 The Prince of Wales is also marking World Oceans Day this year with an interview with Sir David Attenborough ahead of the release of his new documentary, Ocean with David Attenborough.\par \par \uc2 Kensington Palace has released a new film of Prince William and the 99-year-old broadcaster and environmental activist, which sees the pair discussing the current state of the oceans.\par \par \uc2 David's new documentary is set to release on Sunday, which is World Oceans Day. The film has been created to shine a light on the damage humankind has wreaked on the ocean, as well as the opportunities we have to heal it.\par \par \uc2 In their conversation, William and David spoke of the legendary biologist's work in ocean exploration, as well as reasons to remain optimistic for ocean recovery.\par \par \uc2 At the start of the short film, David recalled the first time he ever put on a diving helmet - and nearly drowned as it filled with water.\par \par \uc2 'I suddenly felt water coming up,' he said, gesturing around his chin to show where the water level rose to inside the helmet when he first went underwater.\par \par \uc2 'I thought, 'This can't be right'. And by the time it got to about here,' he said, gesturing to his nose, 'I thought, 'I'm sure this is not right'.\par \par \uc2 'And of course if you've got this thing screwed on top of you, you can't breathe. You can't even make yourself heard, you know. Get it off me!'\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco were joined by their twin children, Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella in welcoming France's President \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2  and his wife \uc2 Brigitte Macron\uc2  on their state visit to the country on Saturday 7 June.\par \par \uc2 The trip was historic for more than one reason. It marks the first visit to Monaco by a French president since \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Mitterrand\uc2  made his journey there in 1984.\par \par \uc2 It was also the first time that 10-year-old royal twins had played a prominent, public role in a state visit.\par \par \uc2 Jacques and Gabriella stood alongside their parents while awaiting the Macrons' arrival at the Prince's Palace in Monaco.\par \par \uc2 The young prince, dressed in a smart navy suit and a printed tie, appeared serious as he stood between his parents, while Gabriella wore a cream-coloured dress with cap sleeves and matching Mary Jane shoes while carrying a small bouquet of flowers.\par \par \uc2 Gabriella was tasked with presenting the bouquet to Brigitte, who gave her a kiss on the cheek in thanks.\par \par \uc2 Albert donned a slightly brighter blue suit compared to his son's, paired with a baby blue tie.\par \par \uc2 Charlene, who is usually known for her glamorous sense of style, cut a more casual figure but was nonetheless chic in her Dior jacket and white straight-cut tailored trousers.\par \par \uc2 The royal family posed for photographs with Macron and Brigitte as the couple's two-day visit got underway.\par \par \uc2 In a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post detailing part of the Macrons' itinerary, the Prince's Palace of Monaco said Charlene took Brigitte for a private stroll around the palace gardens, where they 'shared a moment of sincere exchange, marked by deep kindness and shared commitments to youth'.\par \par \uc2 The two women were joined by Jacques and Gabrielle, who brought their 'relaxed and lively presence' to the scenic walk and reinforced 'direct, human ties that unite France and Monaco from generation to generation', according to the palace.\par \par \uc2 Macron and Brigitte also received traditional military honours from Prince Albert and Princess Charlene in a ceremony at the palace.\par \par \uc2 Document DAMONL0020250608el68003s9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw175\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2625\pichgoal600

I will not highlight the recent assaults on families on the Monterrey-Saltillo highway, but I will emphasize the danger posed by the large number of trailers passing through on their way to other states. I had a godfather notable for having been the composer of some corridos norte\u241\'00\'F1os, such as "Las Tres Tumbas", as well as a movie scriptwriter and filmmaker; his name was Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Garza Arredondo, who at the end of his artistic career was known as "El Viejo Paulino". In his younger days he was a trailer driver, and he assured me that they were like stray bullets on the highways.\par \par \uc2 With all the risks, I drive to the lands of my elders, besides Saltillo and Torreon: Viesca, Parras de la Fuente, San Pedro and the old Hacienda de Patos, today General Cepeda. The week that is about to end was most enlightening for the experiences lived on June 4 in the city of Saltillo, because in the "Full Rights of Coahuilenses Abroad Forum", organized by the binational platform Fuerza Migrante, in the facilities of the Universidad Iberoamericana, I listened to speakers with a lot of knowledge of the migrant issue.\par \par \uc2 YOU MAY BE INTERESTED: The rains will come\par \par \uc2 I was surprised by the simplicity of Felipe de Jes\u250\'00\'FAs Flores de la Pe\u241\'00\'F1a, Undersecretary of Liaison and Operations of the State Government Secretariat, who assured that there were 88 thousand Coahuilenses in the American Union; I was pleased by the clarity and proposals of Karla Ver\u243\'00\'F3nica F\u233\'00\'E9lix Neira, Magistrate President of the Electoral Tribunal of Coahuila, who hinted that a reform to the electoral laws was needed, because she thought it was important for migrants to have a seat in the local Congress and even in the Chamber of Deputies. Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Guadalupe Mart\u237\'00\'EDnez Valero, Director of Legal Affairs of the Saltillo City Hall, represented the Mayor with an academic presentation.\par \par \uc2 Congressman Antonio Attolini Murra, coordinator of the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights, excused himself when the forum was about to begin, having previously confirmed his presence. Fortunately, and without poses, the young lawyer Carolina Hernandez Rodriguez, coordinator of Migratory Affairs of the Iberoamerican University, participated and offered the possibility of counting on this house of studies to plan investigations. The forum was a preamble for future meetings.\par \par \uc2 On June 5, World \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Day, I moderated a memorable forum organized at the Laguna Unit of the Universidad Aut\u243\'00\'F3noma Agraria Antonio Narro (UAAAN), whose director is an excellent human being. It was within the framework of the 45th anniversary of this university in the Comarca Lagunera. With very attractive presentations for the audience, Lorena Gudi\u241\'00\'F1o, coordinator of the German-Mexican Alliance of the German cooperation agency GIZ, participated with surprising prospective information on the impact of \b \highlight22\uc2 climate\b0 \highlight\uc2  change in the region.\par \par \uc2 With great sensitivity, Martha Adriana "Witzilin" Morales Ortiz spoke about the Earth as a living entity. Noted theater artist Jorge Vargas Cortez started from the staging of "Amarillo", to draw the world of Coahuilan migrants in Texas.\par \par \uc2 YOU MAY BE INTERESTED: Trailer diesel tank detaches and overturns on the Saltillo-Zacatecas highway.\par \par \uc2 In the evening, I moderated in the facilities of the Institute of Culture and Education of the municipality of Torreon a conversation about the immense lagoon woman Magda Briones, with the participation of teacher Susana Estens, Secretary of \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Coahuila. Later I will write about this conversation, which closed the exhibition "Paisaje Vivo" (Living Landscape), with paintings by Magda Briones, and which was organized by the director of the institution, Antonio M\u233\'00\'E9ndez Vigat\u225\'00\'E1.\par \par \uc2 However, when I returned to Nuevo Le\u243\'00\'F3n on June 6, I was on the verge of being hit by a trailer. Life can slip away from us at any moment. As I write this, I reevaluate the opportunity to live, even more so when you have a family that you love and a purpose for the common good.\par \par \uc2 Document NFINCE0020250608el680053j\par }\page
